But Evans is desperate not to miss out again after play-off losses for Euro 2013 and last year's  World Cup.
""Now that we're in this position, it would be devastating,"" she said.
""We've been so close and fallen at the last hurdle twice now trying to get to major competitions.
""It would be more heartbreak than humiliation.""
Iceland, ranked one place above the Scots at number 20 in the world, are also unbeaten after four wins from four, with the outcome of Friday's contest and the return fixture in Reykjavik on 20 September likely to decide who tops the group.
""Obviously reaching the finals is everyone's aim,"" said 24-year-old Bayern Munich forward Evans. ""It's been my aim since I got into the squad, and [veteran goalkeeper] Gemma Fay has been aiming for it for 15 years.
""I think it's going to be emotional if we do get there, although we're taking it step by step, trying not to think too far ahead.""
With the best six of the eight group runners-up also qualifying automatically, Scotland are in pole position to reach next summer's finals in the Netherlands without the need for a play-off.
""Iceland are top seeds in the group,"" Evans noted. ""They're a really good side and we've always had tough games against them.
""But we know we've got a really good chance to beat them.
""It would be fantastic to have a big crowd at Falkirk. Having the fans behind us makes a huge difference.""
Evans is one of 12 players in the current 20-strong squad who play outside Scotland, with five at English clubs, four in Sweden and two at Seattle Reign in the United States National Women's Soccer League, including newly-crowned BBC Women's Footballer of the Year Kim Little.
Perth-born Evans recently celebrated winning the women's Bundesliga in her first season at Bayern, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben as they joined the victorious men's squad for a rapturous reception on the balcony at Munich's New Town Hall.
""It was mind-blowing, completely mind-blowing,"" she recalled. ""There were thousands of people cheering when we came out.
""We had a party with the men's team on the Saturday night, having been in their stadium on the Saturday just to get congratulated.
""I actually walked out with Franck Ribery at the Town Hall, but, in the photos, Arjen Robben is in the background. I don't know them very well, but they were all really chatty, really good with us.""
Evans, who won four Scottish Women's Premier League titles and six domestic cups with Glasgow City before moving to Germany with Turbine Potsdam, believes the benefits of having more players in the world's top leagues benefits the national team as they close in on a first major finals.
""Germany has been at the top of women's football for a long time now - it has really developed over there,"" she added.
""The league is good, arguably one of the best in the world for competitiveness, and we have a hard game every week.
""Even within the Bayern set-up, there is such good competition. Just being able to train with those players every day makes you better. I'm really privileged.
""The league in Scotland is improving, but the girls playing abroad bring something different.
""It is a different culture, a new way of playing, and that adds to the national team.""",no

The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break.
Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time.
Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack.
Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.
The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.
The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.
Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.

Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.
The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.
The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.
Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.
Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.
""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.
""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.
""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

The Spaniard became the only man to win three times so far this season.
He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead.
Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end
Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go.
However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap.
Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement.
The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace.
Alonso said: ""It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead.
""Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure.
""But the car was feeling good on top speed and traction and that was enough to keep the lead into Turn 6, and after that overtaking is not so easy.""

The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.
At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.
Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.
It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.
The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.
Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.
Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.
Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.
Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.
Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.
Vettel said: ""The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.
""I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.""
Button said: ""It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.
""When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.
""It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.
""But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.""
Raikkonen provided some exciting racing as he moved up from 10th on the grid.
On the way, Raikkonen engaged in top-class racing with Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher and the Force Indias of Nico Hulkenberg and Paul di Resta.
Schumacher finished seventh behind Sauber drivers Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Perez. Hulkenberg and Di Resta took the final points positions in ninth and 10th.",no
0.6,1.0,0.0,[],"[('right', 'scrap', 'a bid to boost the housing market')]",19311364,TranS2S,"the right to be built in social housing should be scrapped in a bid to boost the housing market, a think tank has said.","Downing Street backed a report by think tank Policy Exchange which said selling high value homes when they become vacant would raise £4.5bn a year.
That would be enough to build 80,000 to 170,000 social homes, the report said.
Labour said new homes were urgently needed but ""driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods"" was not the answer.
In its Ending Expensive Social Tenancies report, Policy Exchange argues the move could create the largest social house building programme since the 1970s - giving the economy a kickstart.
Neil O'Brien, the think tank's director, told the BBC that social housing would still exist in very expensive areas under its proposal, but there would just be ""less of it"".
""The truth is I don't believe anybody has the right to live in the most expensive parts of town.
""People do have a right to get housed, just not in the very most expensive areas,"" he said.
He also suggested that the overall number of people waiting for social housing, currently around 1.8 million, could be reduced by about 500,000 if the scheme was implemented.
The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""This is something that councils can choose to do already.
""Councils should be looking for ways to use their social housing stock as efficiently as they can. The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.
""They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently.
""If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.""
But Labour said the coalition's ""failed"" polices were ""making the housing crisis worse not better"".
Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: ""Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.""
He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and ""put unemployed builders back to work"" and boost the construction industry.
'Lucky family'
Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says.
This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to £159bn if sold.
It says London alone has more than £70bn of expensive social housing.
About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said.
This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising £5.5bn a year. The figure would stand at £4.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said.
Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.
""Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads.
""That seems fairer to me,"" he added.
The think tank also said the move would be ""extremely popular"" with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority.
'Dramatic erosion'
Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos.
The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be ""cleansed"" of ""hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices"".
Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor.
Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's £8bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power.
Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced ""radical reforms"" to ""get Britain building"" and to reduce social housing waiting lists.
They included investing £19.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme ""set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes"".
Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure ""social housing goes to those in greatest need"", he added.",no

He told me the move is ""a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans"".

However, not everyone is so upbeat.
Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.
Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.
The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.
James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities.""
Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"".
He said: ""It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place.""
Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.
Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.
Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.

So what are Bernie's supporters doing differently to bolster his support amongst younger voters? One place where he is a surprising hit is the dating app Tinder.
Kevin Smit from Alkmaar in the Netherlands has used Tinder to spread the Bernie gospel. ""I'm not a heterosexual male and I too believe he's sexy"" he joked to BBC News.
""He's a hit because there's a lot of millennials on the app and he polls amazingly with them"".
Fans of Bernie's Tinder triumphs share their success on Facebook and Tumblr.
Logan Jantzi from New York told BBC News that it was Bernie's policies which lead to his Tinder appeal.
""He discusses problems that are of actual concern to young voters""  he said.
""Gender inequality, low wages, high student loan debt, climate change, these are the things that 18-30 somethings are concerned with.""
Nelson Evans, a Bernie Sanders supporter from California, told BBC News that the popularity of Bernie on social media was because his supporters didn't think their candidate received enough attention in traditional media.
""There's people who even pay the full Tinder membership fees in order to reach others across the country"" he said.
""I think it's effective because, prior to the Iowa caucus, the media has completely shut Bernie out of the news cycle. For every 81 minutes of election coverage he'd get 10 seconds and Bernie supporters know that.""
""But people who get their election news from the mainstream media, they have no idea what Bernie is all about. That's sort of what started the Tinder thing.
""It's amazing how you see people from 17-29 who have gone from never being interested in politics to being completely enveloped by it.
""This election represents more than just a candidate. It's an indication that the youth know what direction they want our country to go, and they're ready to work vigorously for it,"" he added.
The hashtag #demdebate has been used more than 600,000 times over the past 24 hours to discuss the debate between Clinton and Sanders:
Both candidates have their names shortened on Twitter to fit with the platform's character limit.
Hillary Clinton is commonly called '#HRC' by supporters, a term which has featured in more than 49,700 tweets over the past 24 hours while the term #Bernie far surpassed that and was used in 322,000 tweets.
On Facebook, Bernie Sanders' personal page has almost three million likes while Hillary Clinton is only able to manage 2.3 million.
But his popularity on social sites won't necessarily translate into Bernie Sanders becoming the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.

The evidence will be used to develop recommendations for care providers and public bodies.
It is part of Ms Rochira's review into the quality of life and care of older people in residential care in Wales.
She said she would highlight good care but also show the impact of poor care upon older people.
""The voices of older people, as well as those who care for and care about them, are at the heart of my work as commissioner, which is why I want to hear about their experiences of residential care,"" she said.
""I have travelled extensively across Wales, meeting with many older people living in residential care, and have seen for myself the positive impact that high quality care can have on people's lives.
""However, I have also received an increasing amount of correspondence in the past year about the quality of life and care of older people living in residential care and I have spoken publicly about what I consider to be unacceptable variations across Wales.""
The commissioner will be reviewing whether older people living in residential care have a good quality of life by looking at factors such as physical and psychological health, social relationships and the care home environment.
Her team will also speak to care providers, social care staff and public bodies.
""By giving a voice to older people and their families, my review and recommendations will ensure that those who are accountable for and run our services understand the day-to-day realities of living in residential care in Wales and the action required to deliver the change needed to ensure that that older people living in residential care have the best quality of life,"" she said.
The chair of Care Forum Wales, Mario Kreft, said his group was dedicated to developing and promoting best practice in social care and it supported the overall aims of the review.
""Our disappointment however - which will be shared by many providers - is that the commissioner has not included a provider expert on the main advisory panel,"" he said.
""As far as we can see no-one who has lived in, worked in, managed or owned a care home is represented on the panel.
""In our view, this misses the opportunity for partnership working and to engage the sector fully into the advisory panel.""",no

His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
""It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office,"" Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.

Rigging supervisor Steve Innes, from Sunderland, told the BBC he and fellow Wood Group contractors discovered they had been exposed to alpha radiation.
EnQuest said ""additional precautionary steps"" had since been taken.
Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety.
Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing.
He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care.
The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment.
Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip.
He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped.
He said: ""We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear.
""At first we were all in shock.
""We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time.""
He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests.
Mr Innes said of EnQuest: ""They have a duty of care. Their procedures have broken down.
""You can't say 'you've been contaminated but we think you'll be OK'.
""I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies.""
An EnQuest spokesperson said: ""EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material).
""The level of exposure was less than 1% of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time.
""EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM.
""Following an investigation, additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure.""
A Wood Group spokeswoman said: ""The health and safety of our people is always our top priority.
""As a precaution following the incident, we downmanned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments.
""We fully supported EnQuest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures, to ensure the safety of our employees.
""Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees.""
John Boland, regional officer for the Unite union, said: ""Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible.
""It's vital for workers' safety that there is openness and transparency about serious safety incidents, so that we can learn lessons and create a safer working environment for everyone offshore.""
A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said: ""HSE has been made aware of this incident.

Whether or not either Turk will delight enough to be hits with their new clubs, it is another loanee who has the potential to set Celtic Park alight if he lives up to his market value.
Patrick Roberts moved to Manchester City in the summer for about £12m and the 18-year-old winger has 18 months with the reigning Scottish champions in which to prove himself worthy of the fee paid to Fulham.
Kazim-Richards is perhaps even more of a gamble, not only because of his off-field antics but also for a lack of career goals, and steady Erik Sviatchenko is maybe a safer bet to prove worthy of the £1.5m Celtic paid Midtjylland for the Denmark defender.
Celtic might need to squeeze every last pound of value out of their new arrivals to thwart a sustained Aberdeen title challenge that appears to have surprised even those inside Pittodrie.
The Dandies' deadline-day signing of Simon Church on loan from MK Dons means they have a striker hungry for goals to ensure his place in Wales' Euro 2016 finals squad.
However, the Dons may live to regret their bungled attempt to sign Greg Tansey from Inverness Caledonian Thistle in events that left them minus the additional cover in central midfield manager Derek McInnes thought necessary.
While they brought in two replacements, the recall by Liverpool of promising goalkeeper Danny Ward could also prove costly in the long run.

And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride.

""Latham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there.
""We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him.

Drummer Dave Harper, who runs the shop, is now looking for a new site. ""We need to be somewhere else,"" he said. ""Not existing is not an option.""
The band opened Pop Recs Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few bricks-and-mortar stores left to sell it.
Housed in the city's former tourist information office, it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks.
But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists.
It also became a community hub, hosting regular music tuition plus poetry, stitching and toddler groups.

The festival is running until 9 September and bringing together leading artists from across the world.
Turning Points was premiered at Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff on Wednesday night.
Tally Evans said his film celebrated life changing moments when a meeting, an event, or something unexpected led to a new and better direction.
It started as a nationwide story-telling project aimed at inspiring and changing the lives of others by collecting stories from people of all ages, abilities and walks of life.
Tally Evans, who has written and presented programmes for BBC TV and radio, said: ""It's fantastic to get the chance to have my work included in such a momentous festival and I'm looking forward to the film transferring to the Southbank Centre in London (from 31 August to 9 September).""
""I think it was meeting a man in Hollywood, a dialogue director called Joe Graham.
""Warner Brothers thought that I sounded too English. They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'
""He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'
""I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?""
""He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.
""He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.
""He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'.
And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.""
There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.
""It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience,"" added Tally Evans.
""There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.""
Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996.
Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted.
Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape.
Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion.
There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas.
In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted.
A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a ""very unhappy man"".
""I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted,"" Tally Evans said.
""I never saw my social worker again.""
The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart.
Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: ""Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.""",yes

The floodlights were replaced but the switch-on was put in doubt when two lights were stolen.
Reverend Alyson Buxton said it was ""fantastic"" to see the church lit up.
""We've all been so excited for this moment,"" she said.
""It's wonderful to see so many people here who've had a wonderful service inside. There's at least 400 people here so it's absolutely fantastic.""
The lights were switched on by BBC Radio Lincolnshire presenters Carla George and Scott Dalton.
Peter Sherlock, who gave the church Â£2,000 to reinstall the stolen lights, was among those present and said the service was ""very moving"".
He is still offering a reward of Â£2,000 for information about who stole the lights.
Matt Warman, the Boston and Skegness MP, was also there.
""A lot of Boston's heritage is about this building and it's hugely significant for everyone,"" he said.

Rigging supervisor Steve Innes, from Sunderland, told the BBC he and fellow Wood Group contractors discovered they had been exposed to alpha radiation.
EnQuest said ""additional precautionary steps"" had since been taken.
Wood Group said it was committed to employee safety.
Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing.
He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care.
The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment.
Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip.
He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped.
He said: ""We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear.
""At first we were all in shock.
""We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time.""
He said they had been told the levels of radiation may not cause them long-term harm, but he was continuing to undergo tests.
Mr Innes said of EnQuest: ""They have a duty of care. Their procedures have broken down.
""You can't say 'you've been contaminated but we think you'll be OK'.
""I would like somebody to take the case on who's not frightened of the companies.""
An EnQuest spokesperson said: ""EnQuest can confirm that, in December 2016, during planned shutdown activities on its Thistle platform, six personnel employed by Wood Group under a contract with EnQuest were removing a piece of pipework when they were exposed to low levels of NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material).
""The level of exposure was less than 1% of the level at which it is reportable to the Health and Safety Executive however EnQuest advised the HSE of the matter at the time.
""EnQuest has appropriate control measures in place which are designed to prevent exposure to NORM.
""Following an investigation, additional precautionary steps have been taken to further ensure that personnel avoid any such exposure.""
A Wood Group spokeswoman said: ""The health and safety of our people is always our top priority.
""As a precaution following the incident, we downmanned our employees from the platform in order to conduct medical assessments.
""We fully supported EnQuest in a detailed joint investigation and continue to reinforce the application of our health and safety procedures, to ensure the safety of our employees.
""Our commitment and priority following the incident and throughout the investigation has been to the health and wellbeing of our employees.""
John Boland, regional officer for the Unite union, said: ""Unite believes that the way these workers has been treated is terrible.
""It's vital for workers' safety that there is openness and transparency about serious safety incidents, so that we can learn lessons and create a safer working environment for everyone offshore.""
A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said: ""HSE has been made aware of this incident.

This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.
Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality
The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.
Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.
This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.
In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.
They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.
Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.
They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.
But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.
There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.
Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.
In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.
Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.
Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.
But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.
So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.
Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.
So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?
Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.
It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.
This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.
The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.
Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.
They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it.
But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.
Extend, yes, but for just one more year.
Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.
Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?
Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?
Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?
The third, it appears, was the clincher.
When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.
But that all changed on 23 June.
Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.
If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.
Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?
That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.
And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.
But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.
The reasons were personal and unique.
In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.
Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.
For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.
He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.
""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.
""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.
""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""
Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.
Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.
Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.
But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.
By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.",no

Veterinary surgeon Dr Sandra Corr puts Daisy the sheep through a very hands-on physical examination.
""I'm looking for any signs of crepitus or lameness,"" she says, ""Anything that might indicate the onset of disease or osteoarthritis.""
But Daisy is not just any sheep. She's a clone. One of a flock of 13 cloned sheep currently living out their lives on a farm owned by the University of Nottingham, and one of only four (the others are Debbie, Denise and Diane) cloned from the same adult ewe as Dolly the sheep - the first cloned mammal born in 1996.
This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters.
""Where there was one Dolly, with these four girls, now there are five,"" he says.
We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests.
As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation.
But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world.
According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results.
He tells me: ""One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?""
Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some ""age-memory"" might be transferred into the next generation.
""That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,"" says Prof Sinclair.
""A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.""
The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down.
But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones.
""We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky"", recalled Prof Sinclair, ""or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals.""
Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans.
Prof Sinclair said: ""We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities.""
The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health.

Her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, has criticised the UK government for a lack of action and said the appeal against the term was happening in ""secret"".
It is understood it is being held in Tehran on Wednesday.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38 has spent time in solitary confinement since her arrest at Tehran Airport last April, with her two-year-old daughter Gabriella.
The child has remained in Iran after the government confiscated her passport and is being looked after by her grandparents.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail in September on charges that have not been disclosed.
Mr Ratcliffe said the family could not go to his wife's appeal hearing and did not know when to expect a result as it was ""another of these secret trials"".
He said: ""Obviously her father is terrified, as am I. We are increasingly on tenterhooks as to what could happen.""
Mr Ratcliffe, 41, believes his wife is being used as a bargaining chip in a diplomatic row between Iran and the UK.
He said he will know when the appeal has happened and what was said in the courtroom but the final outcome ""might come today, it might come next week"".
There was a gap of about four weeks between his wife's trial and the verdict, he added.
Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had felt suicidal and had started a hunger strike during her time in jail but there was ""more fight in her"" since being moved out of solitary confinement over Christmas.
He told BBC Breakfast the outcome of the appeal was ""unpredictable"" as it could see her sentence quashed, reduced or increased.
Speaking about his daughter, Mr Ratcliffe said: ""I have watched her grow up on Skype.
""She has lost her English, and she is now pretty much fluent in Farsi - with only a few words in English.
""Conversations now either have to be translated through one of her aunts and uncles or they are very physical - so playing peekaboo and watching her dancing.""

Separately, many of those in the self-assessment system must pay a tax bill.
This so-called payment on account is the equivalent of half the previous year's tax bill, as an advance payment on their next bill. The other half is paid on 31 January.
HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) warned that anyone who failed to renew their tax credits could be in danger of having payments stopped, or find themselves paying more than they needed to.
""It is great that millions of people have renewed their tax credits or reported changes so far, but anyone who has not done so yet should take action now - it only takes a few minutes to renew online,"" said Nick Lodge, of HMRC.
Renewals can now also be completed via smartphone apps. The tax credit helpline - 0345 3003900 - is open until 20:00 BST on Saturday and Sunday.
To renew, they will need their renewal pack, their National Insurance number, their and their partners total income for the tax year to April 2016, the 15-digit number on their renewal pack, and details of any changes to their circumstances, such as working hours and children.
Claimants who received notices in a brown A5 envelope will see their tax credits renewed automatically and are only required to contact HMRC if they need to make any corrections or notify HMRC of any changes to household circumstances.
Those whose notices came in a white A4 envelope must renew, even if their circumstances have not changed.
The tax payment deadline affects everyone in the self-assessment system unless:
There are various ways of paying but those leaving it to the weekend are likely to be limited to paying via online or telephone banking, or via the HMRC website using a debit or credit card.
Interest is charged if the payment deadline is missed. After 28 days without payment, following the deadline, a surcharge is 5% of any unpaid tax is levied. This surcharge is repeated after six months.

It said the council tax had built-in problems ""from day one"" but a failure to modify it had stored up more difficulties for policy makers.
The commission, set up by the Scottish government and council body Cosla, will report back later this year.
Prof Kenneth Gibb, from the University of Glasgow, was asked to review different systems of local taxation across the world.
He found that a tax on property was used by almost all OECD countries and was seen by academics as a ""good tax"" because it was stable, difficult to avoid and could have a desirable impact on housing markets.
But it also generated confusion with taxpayers unclear whether it was a tax on wealth or a charge for services such as refuse collection.
Some felt it was unfair because it was not linked to current income.
Prof Gibb noted that a local income tax, used by many countries, was generally perceived as fairer.
But he found such a system created difficulties for local authorities because it meant their income fluctuated. There was also little opportunity to vary tax rates to reflect local priorities.
He said:  ""It is clear there is no magic bullet.
""Past experience from the UK and across the world shows that reform is always going to be difficult and will inevitably be bound up with the previous experiences and traumas of past reform.
""So whilst the current council tax has many deficiencies, change and reform is a major undertaking.""
The commission now intends to hold a public consultation across Scotland before publishing its report in the autumn.
A Scottish government spokesman said ministers consider the current council tax system ""as a whole to be unfair"".
He added: ""That is why, along with our local government partners, we have established the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform to examine fairer alternatives.
""The Scottish government awaits the commission's report, which is due in the Autumn.""",no

The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of ""destabilising the market"".
Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.
The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.
The news agency said ""seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II"" were also among the offences.

The photographs span the period from the 1880s to the 1990s and illustrate just how much life for a child has changed and also how special occasions were marked on the city's streets.
The oldest image dates back to 1887 and is a portrait of Florence, George and Gertie Rollo, who came from Waterloo Park.
The Rollo family lived in a large home in the area called Stone House and had four servants. The picture shows the children dressed up in costumes for a fancy dress ball hosted by the Mayor and Mayoress of Bootle, Alderman and Mrs Howard.
As well as showing children at play, another image reminds us that many youngsters were also sent out to work.
A nervous looking young maid for a well-to-do Liverpool family is captured in a great portrait which is thought to have been taken about 1900.

Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment.
Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed.""
But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended.
World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"".
It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment.""
In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities.

1.0,1.0,1.0,[],[],38713957,PtGen,the family of a [UNK] say they have found a unique way to swim in the sea off the coast of australia.,"Walter Bartram was prospecting in dusty terrain in Coober Pedy, about 750km (466 miles) north of Adelaide, in 1946 when he staked a claim to what became called the Fire of Australia.
Although his family achieved success in opal trading, their greatest discovery has been seen rarely by the public.
That has just changed.
The 998g (35.2oz) opal, valued at nearly A$900,000 (Â£550,000; $680,000), is now on display in Adelaide's South Australian Museum.
Still largely in its original condition, the opal's two polished faces reveal a kaleidoscope of colours from green to yellow to red.
""When my father was alive, it was originally kept separately from all trading because it was such a significant piece,"" Alan Bartram told the BBC.
""We decided we would retain that intention, and keep it as a significant and obviously excellent example of light opal from South Australia.""
The family has decided to pass it on for future generations to enjoy.
The museum's director, Brian Oldman, said the opal's rarity should not be underestimated.
""Opal of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions,"" Mr Oldman said.
""When our state's inland sea evaporated millions of years ago, it provided a unique silica-rich environment for the creation of precious opal. It is these exceptional conditions that created the Fire of Australia.""
A mining town for more than 100 years, Coober Pedy still draws people lured by the hope of striking it rich.
""They're becoming more scarce because the overheads of mining now are getting to be so expensive - in fuel, explosives, machinery and living costs on the field,"" Mr Bartram said.
""But South Australia supplies about 90% of the world's quality opals. There may be more major finds.""

Murray looked like avoiding a long, drawn-out contest when he moved ahead early in the third set but a Friday night drama would develop as the light faded.
Fognini, 30, showed both his talented and temperamental sides as he got within sight of a fifth set, which would have required the roof to be brought across or both men to return on Saturday.
The Italian, who recently beat Murray on clay in Rome, looked well off the pace when he double-faulted twice in a row to lose the first set, but he began to assert himself in the second.
Fognini broke for a second time to lead 3-2 and went on to level at one set all, before firing his 13th baseline winner to just one for Murray by the start of the third set.
At 30-30, Murray was on the defensive and looking increasingly vulnerable, but he clung on with a second serve and the scream of relief jolted him and the Centre Court crowd to life.
Across the net, Fognini's challenge was apparently fading, an ankle injury not helping as the errors flowed and the set slipped away.
A gripping fourth set unfolded, with passions rising on and off court as Fognini was penalised a point for a visible obscenity following a gesture, and Murray complaining to the umpire that the Italian was taking too long between points.
It was Fognini who took control after Murray double-faulted in game six, but from 5-2 down Murray showed all his fighting qualities to save set points in three consecutive games.
The 15,000 spectators on Centre Court were on their feet as the Briton levelled at 5-5, and Fognini could not halt Murray's momentum as the champion served his way to victory.
""I feel OK,"" added Murray. ""I didn't feel I moved as well as the first couple of matches but I've got a couple of days break now and can work on that and hopefully get myself in a good rhythm and play some good tennis on Monday.

0.6,1.0,0.0,[],"[('satellite', 'publish', ""a new survey of the world's largest satellite satellite"")]",16025568,TConvS2S,"the world's largest satellite satellite, the team, has published a new survey of the world's largest satellite satellite.","In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km.
By the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km.
The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.
It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy.
The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues.
It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north.
The team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.
""We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,"" explained Ms Gardent.
""Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.""
The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.
By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.
Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.
This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.
""The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,"" Ms Gardent emphasised.
""We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.""
The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.
Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.
At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.

The charity, Fresh Start Housing, finds clients from London homeless charities.
Neither the charity nor the company act illegally, but a homeless group says the relationship is ""a new low"".
Investing Solutions said ""the bulk"" of their rents get passed to private landlords, while Fresh Start said they referred clients to both Investing Solutions and private landlords.
The letting agent makes money by putting several unrelated people in one house and charging housing benefit for each person, rather than the property. Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.
Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London.
Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010.
The documents say the charity would help ""the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress"".
Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable.
In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming £2,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants.
The owner of the house was getting £1,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of £11,568 on the one property.
The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing ""the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation"".
But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to £260 per week for each private room.
One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.
He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.
Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.
""It's all about the money, it's not about the people,"" he added. ""I thought inspections would be made.""
Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than £2.1m.
The council said it has a ""dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable"".
Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.""
Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees.
He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords ""who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients"".
He also said his company was ""genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property"".
Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.
It also said it did not have ""authority from the relevant parties"" to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.

The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff.
Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos.
Last month, a £1.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's £1.4bn offer.
Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business.
Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers.
The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.
Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been ""another rather eventful period"" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.
Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.
The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a ""world-leading"" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.
Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.""
Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.
However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos.

On Friday, the US chose not to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an end to settlement construction.
The decision to abstain infuriated Mr Netanyahu, whose spokesman said on Tuesday he had ""ironclad information"" from Arab sources that the White House had helped draft the language of the resolution and ""pushed hard"" for its passage.
A US state department spokesman said the accusation was ""just not true"", but he hoped the resolution would ""serve as a wake-up call"" for Israel.
More than 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
The Security Council resolution passed on Friday stated that the establishment of settlements ""has no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law and a major obstacle to the achievement of the two-state solution and a just, lasting and comprehensive peace"".
Israel rejected the resolution, and the BBC's Yolande Knell said it was particularly angry about the condemnation of building in East Jerusalem - which it sees as part of its capital, but which the Palestinians want as the capital of their future state.
Mr Netanyahu responded over the weekend by summoning the ambassadors of the US and the 14 countries on the Security Council who voted in favour of the resolution, recalling Israel's ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal, cutting aid to Senegal, and cancelling a visit by Ukraine's prime minister.
The Jerusalem Planning and Housing Committee had indicated it would press ahead with a planned vote on authorising 492 new homes in the settlements of Ramat Shlomo and Ramot.
But on Wednesday, planning committee member Hanan Rubin said the vote had been postponed.
Mr Rubin told the BBC this was at the request of the prime minister's office, to avoid further straining relations with Washington hours before Mr Kerry's speech.

McIlroy was level par for the day after 10 holes, dropping his first shots of the week by three-putting the third and 10th, the latter mistake prompting the 26-year-old to throw his putter at his bag.
But he hit back with a birdie on the par-five 11th and a towering four iron from 229 yards on the 13th set up an eagle from just four feet.
The former world number one ruptured a ligament in his left ankle during a game of football with friends in July, ruling him out of several tournaments.
But he returned in time to unsuccessfully defend his US PGA title at Whistling Straits in August and played in three of the FedEx Cup play-off events before starting the new PGA Tour season with a tie for 26th in the Frys.com Open in California.

He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez's header.
In between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal.
Striker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on.
Arsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez's intervention.
The visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs' low shot and as the ball ricocheted off goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean's hand and into the net.
For a deliberate handball, Football Association laws state:

On this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic.
After consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given.
After the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time.
Robertson added: ""The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure. Not many referees can admit they're wrong, so it's good when he does, though it doesn't make things better.""

Chasing the game in the second half, Hull's Lazar Markovic was running onto a long punt forward deep in the Arsenal half.
The Serb was barged down by Gibbs, who was the last defender, and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed, he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards.
Clattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card.
Gibbs said after the game: ""I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic. The ref said the ball was going away from goal.""
When asked if Gibbs should have been sent off, Hull boss Marco Silva said: ""Yes. It is true. Markovic go to the goal.""
With Hull pushing for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter by the home side. Jakupovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post, but the Spaniard's goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas' arm on the line. Clucas was given a red card for the incident.
Sanchez stepped up to take the penalty, drilling a low finish into the net, which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games.
It was also his 17th top-flight strike this season, making him the league's leading marksman.

Arsenal had lost back-to-back league games against Watford and Chelsea to leave their title challenge in disarray.
But the win moves them up to third in the table, nine points behind leaders Chelsea.
For Hull, it was an unlucky defeat, having come close to scoring in both halves, but they have now failed to find the net in 12 of their 25 games - more than any other side.
Despite the defeat, Tigers supporters will be buoyed by the impact made by new manager Silva as his side look well-equipped for a battle to stay in the top-flight, yet they remain in the relegation zone by a single point.
Former Hull defender Peter Swan on BBC Radio Humberside
Hull City's performance was strong, and they did really all they could. The referee's decisions have hurt Hull today, but the side are showing they have got a very real chance of staying up.
For the second goal, you have got to feel sorry for Clucas. His keeper has stitched him right up. It was an easy decision for Clattenburg.
And do you want to know the irony? Jakupovic had probably made up the ground and was covering behind Clucas, not that the defender knew.
Arsene Wenger speaking to Match of the Day: ""We were resilient, focused and organised, but a bit with the handbrake on as we were under pressure to win the game. In the end perhaps we were fortunate to get away with a positive result.
Hull boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: ""The most important thing is the result. It was a very good second half. We had control of it and caused Arsenal problems.
""They started the game better than us and after the story of the first half they score with handball. We didn't deserve this result.

Cycling - which brought Team GB 12 medals in Rio - has had its funding cut by more than £4m to £25.98m.
Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said he was ""staggered"" by the ""incomprehensible"" decision to remove the sport's funding.
A total of £345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - £2m less than the record £347m allocated for the Rio Games.
As a result, UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning 51-85 Olympic medals, and 115-162 Paralympic medals in Tokyo.
Britain enjoyed unprecedented success at Rio 2016, with the Olympics yielding 67 medals and the Paralympics 147.
Chair of UK Sport Rod Carr said the government, which provides funding alongside National Lottery money, has ""confirmed its commitment"" for Tokyo 2020.
He added: ""These are critical funding decisions for sports to take them on their journey to Tokyo 2020 and beyond so the historic success at Rio can be maintained.""
Badminton, which was set a target of winning a medal in Rio, is the only sport that earned a podium place in the summer to have its funding removed.
Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge took bronze in the men's doubles after the sport was given £5.74m in the last cycle.
Christy said the decision represents a ""catastrophic impact on the sport"" and Badminton England would ""fight for the hopes and dreams"" of its players.
""How can you return from the best Games for more than a decade, in a year where our players have demonstrated world-class performances and where we can demonstrate the journey to Tokyo is on track, only be to have every penny of investment withdrawn?"" he said.
""What have we done wrong?"" added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin.
Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly.
Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly.
""We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential,"" she said.
""If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk.""
Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: ""UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020.""
Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build ""performance pathways for future success"" was supposed to be aimed at such sports.
A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: ""It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review.
""With UK Sport's investment budget approaching £350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport.""
UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed.
Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme.
UK Sport says funding will be determined ""following further exploration of medal potential"", with £9m of the £345m total still to be allocated.
Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: ""The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open.
""We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.""",no

The line was closed for two months in 2014 after it was destroyed by storms.
Network Rail said the study would be ""key"" to long-term developments.
The report, published in the Journal of Transport Geography, said that 10% of journeys on the line, which was rebuilt and reopened in April 2014, could be affected by 2040.
The report said adverse weather disrupted the line about 10 days per year, but according to sea-level predictions that could rise to almost 40 by 2040 and up to 120 by 2100.
Academics from Plymouth University, the University of Leeds and the University of York identified a link between sea-level change and rail incidents over the last 150 years.
The academics said there could be similar implications for other vulnerable stretches of railway throughout Wales, south-east England, the Cumbrian coast and Scotland.
Dr David Dawson, from the University of Leeds, said the long-term future of the line was ""really worrying"".
The report predicts diverting routes could potentially cost billions of pounds.
Network Rail said it hoped to develop ""long-term interventions"" to ""secure the future"" of the line.
The Department for Transport said it had invested Â£31m into improving the resilience of the route and was ""exploring the potential for longer-term improvements in the area"".

""You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.""
The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.
The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.
That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.
But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.
The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.
They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.
By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.

And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.
When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.
They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

He added a penalty in injury-time which was awarded after Sam Clucas was sent off for handball from Lucas Perez's header.
In between, Hector Bellerin and Sanchez both failed to hit the target and Mesut Ozil volleyed over the crossbar for Arsenal.
Striker Oumar Niasse had Hull's best chances - his header and low strike forced Petr Cech into sharp saves - while Adama Diomande nodded over late on.
Arsenal had been pressing for the opener before Sanchez's intervention.
The visitors failed to clear Kieran Gibbs' low shot and as the ball ricocheted off goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic on the ground it bounced off the Chilean's hand and into the net.
For a deliberate handball, Football Association laws state:

On this occasion, Sanchez did not look like he purposefully pushed the ball into the net and he had little time to move out of the way after the ball came off Jakupovic.
After consultation with his assistant, referee Mark Clattenburg awarded the goal, but prior to that in the first half, Theo Walcott had a shot blocked by the hand of Clucas inside the area, for which no penalty was given.
After the game, Hull defender Andrew Robertson told Sky Sports that Clattenburg had apologised to the Hull players after half-time.
Robertson added: ""The ref told us he didn't give it because he wasn't 100% sure. Not many referees can admit they're wrong, so it's good when he does, though it doesn't make things better.""

Chasing the game in the second half, Hull's Lazar Markovic was running onto a long punt forward deep in the Arsenal half.
The Serb was barged down by Gibbs, who was the last defender, and had the on-loan Liverpool man not been infringed, he would have had a clear run through on goal from 30 yards.
Clattenburg spotted the incident and presented a yellow card.
Gibbs said after the game: ""I took a chance with the challenge on Markovic. The ref said the ball was going away from goal.""
When asked if Gibbs should have been sent off, Hull boss Marco Silva said: ""Yes. It is true. Markovic go to the goal.""
With Hull pushing for an equaliser, they were hit on the counter by the home side. Jakupovic came sprinting off his line as Sanchez went round him and picked out Perez at the back post, but the Spaniard's goal-bound header was kept out by Clucas' arm on the line. Clucas was given a red card for the incident.
Sanchez stepped up to take the penalty, drilling a low finish into the net, which was his seventh goal against Hull in just four games.
It was also his 17th top-flight strike this season, making him the league's leading marksman.

Arsenal had lost back-to-back league games against Watford and Chelsea to leave their title challenge in disarray.
But the win moves them up to third in the table, nine points behind leaders Chelsea.
For Hull, it was an unlucky defeat, having come close to scoring in both halves, but they have now failed to find the net in 12 of their 25 games - more than any other side.
Despite the defeat, Tigers supporters will be buoyed by the impact made by new manager Silva as his side look well-equipped for a battle to stay in the top-flight, yet they remain in the relegation zone by a single point.
Former Hull defender Peter Swan on BBC Radio Humberside
Hull City's performance was strong, and they did really all they could. The referee's decisions have hurt Hull today, but the side are showing they have got a very real chance of staying up.
For the second goal, you have got to feel sorry for Clucas. His keeper has stitched him right up. It was an easy decision for Clattenburg.
And do you want to know the irony? Jakupovic had probably made up the ground and was covering behind Clucas, not that the defender knew.
Arsene Wenger speaking to Match of the Day: ""We were resilient, focused and organised, but a bit with the handbrake on as we were under pressure to win the game. In the end perhaps we were fortunate to get away with a positive result.
Hull boss Marco Silva told BBC Sport: ""The most important thing is the result. It was a very good second half. We had control of it and caused Arsenal problems.
""They started the game better than us and after the story of the first half they score with handball. We didn't deserve this result.

The tremor was felt as far away as Milan and Florence, Italian media say. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.
Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.
Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.
Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.
Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports. As a precaution, schools were said to have been evacuated in the immediate vicinity and were to be checked for any damage.
In Milan, top floors of tall office blocks shook and the quake was also felt in the cities of Bologna and Modena.
In Lucca, people poured out into the streets, Ansa said.
Last May, two earthquakes in the same area left more than 20 people dead. The strongest tremor was magnitude-6 and caused significant damage.
Alessandro Amato of the INGV said the latest tremor ""came out of nowhere"", and described it as a classic earthquake for the area - ""medium-strong"" and ""fairly shallow"".
Italy is still trying to recover from the aftermath of the deadly earthquake in L'Aquila.
Six scientists and an ex-official were convicted of multiple manslaughter in October 2012 for giving a falsely reassuring statement.
The group, all members of the National Commission for the Forecast and Prevention of Serious Risks, were accused of having provided ""inaccurate, incomplete and contradictory"" information about the danger of the tremors felt ahead of the 6 April 2009 quake.
At a meeting a few days before the deadly quake, they had told officials in L'Aquila that, while a major earthquake was not impossible, it was not likely.
On the night of the quake, many people are said to have remained in their homes and died because of the advice, while others who had decided to remain outside in the street survived.",no

Jamie Mitchell, 35, of Apple Close, had admitted intervening in an argument between Mr Dickie and his mother.
He shouted ""yes"" and was visibly shaking after the verdict was announced by a jury at Winchester Crown Court.
The trial heard Mrs Mitchell and Mr Dickie had been in a relationship for several years and were going through a ""down phase"" when Mr Mitchell visited his mother at the park on 7 May.
In the evening, Mr Mitchell accompanied his mother and Mr Dickie to the holiday park bar and got ""tanked up"" on alcohol.
The two men had a confrontation outside and were separated by members of the public.
Mr Mitchell had pleaded guilty to common assault in relation to the fight.

Ipswich had failed to score in seven of their previous 10 Championship games, but could have had plenty more, with Christophe Berra heading wide from six yards, and Skuse firing a volley straight at Smithies.

Stubbs, 44, decided to return to England shortly after ending Hibs' 114-year wait to win the Scottish Cup.
""They fitted in with my ambition,"" Stubbs said of Rotherham.
The Englishman has signed a three-year deal with the Millers, who reached a settlement with Hibs over compensation for Stubbs and his assistant, John Doolan.
""Alan and his staff have done a magnificent job, with the pinnacle obviously being that historic Scottish Cup win for which every Hibernian supporter is thankful,"" said Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster. ""We wish them every success in the future
""The task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland's top flight by winning the Championship this season.
""We expect high calibre candidates, and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation, as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say.""
Speaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium, Stubbs admitted it was a ""really difficult decision"" to leave Hibs, but that moving to the Championship in England was ""the next chapter"" for his career.
Rotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart.
""I was impressed by what the chairman had to say, what his vision is for the club and the ambition,"" he explained.
""The club's had two seasons where they've stabilised in the Championship and we're looking to take the club forward. We want to be moving up the table and ultimately we want to be a club that is around the play-offs. That has to be the aim.

""The plan has always been to be the best I can. I wanted to manage at the very top level. I got a great opportunity at Hibernian, they've been fantastic with me, I really enjoyed my two years there.
""I'm glad I've been able to leave on the back of a successful end to the season but now it's a new chapter and one that's very exciting for me.""
Stewart insisted that, despite lengthy talks with Hibs over compensation - and Stubbs and Doolan ultimately resigning from their posts - relations between the two clubs were fine. And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club.
""Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs,"" Stewart said. ""My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment. We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely.
""We've followed Alan's career. He was on the radar months ago, the timing was right and we took the opportunity. I like the drive, the leadership.

Hogwood worked with many leading orchestras around the world and was considered one of the most influential exponents of the early-music movement.
The conductor founded the Academy of Ancient Music (AAM) in 1973 and directed the academy across six continents for some 30 years.
The AAM also made more than 200 CDs, including the first-ever complete cycle of Mozart symphonies on period instruments.
Among his most famous recordings include the 1980 version of Handel's Messiah with Emma Kirkby and Carolyn Watkinson, which was named by BBC Music Magazine as one of the top 20 recordings of all time.
Hogwood studied keyboard at Cambridge University with Rafael Puyana and Mary Potts and later with Zuzana Ruzickova and Gustav Leonhardt.
His first positions were as a keyboard player and musicologist with the Academy of Saint Martin-in-the-Fields under Sir Neville Marriner, and was a founder member of the Early Music Consort of London.
He was the artistic director of the King's Lynn Festival and Boston's Handel and Haydn Society. He was also a tutor at Harvard University, honorary professor of music at the University of Cambridge and a professor-at-large at Cornell University in the US.
""Christopher had extraordinary generosity of spirit,"" Christopher Purvis, honorary president of the AAM, said.
""He was a great ambassador for historically informed music, the movement of which he was a founder. And he was happy to see the orchestra he founded develop and grow after he stepped down as director.""
The AAM's music director Richard Egarr added: ""I am deeply saddened by the news of Christopher's passing. Christopher provided a fantastic legacy for me to build upon when I joined in 2006 and I know he will be greatly missed by all who knew and worked with him.""
Speaking to Sean Rafferty on Radio 3's In Tune, soprano Dame Emma Kirkby said: ""Some of the best players that now lead orchestras all over the world, they started with him.
""Chris was a natural academic, an incredibly clever man. He had an amazing capacity to absorb information of all kinds and a really sure sense of how things would be if he really tried to reproduce conditions... a very genial person.""

So President Trump's ""Climate Brexit"" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not.
It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy.
How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile.
Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things ""in perspective"".
Tillerson had previously said the US should ""maintain its seat at the table"" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement.
But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony.
Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and ""maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand"".
No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments.
But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House.
Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement.
Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map.
The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement.
Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck.
""We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,"" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration.
""We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.""
To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty.
But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on.
So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.

Natural Resources Wales said it was ""difficult to conclude"" that the replacement land was of equal value, but it was not opposing the development overall.
But an ecology report presented by the developers said there would be a ""net gain"" in biodiversity because the plans included work to enhance other habitats nearby - which the Gwent wildlife trust argued against.

""When I do this I shake, I feel nauseous,"" she says.
""This goes to one bank, that to another, then the third one… There's one more bank, but we don't have the money for them - I had to go and buy some food. I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.""
Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about £10,800; $17,000) to those four banks.
After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (£107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job.
Millions of those in debt live like Elena.
According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages.
By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months.
The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (£10.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks.
For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones.
It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions.
""We were a bit stupid,"" Elena says. ""They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.""
During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about.
Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict.
The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles.
Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because ""the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals"". Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says.
Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October.
Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead.
Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution.
A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: ""I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!""
Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and ""this year it's probably going to be around 16%"".
He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow.
Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents.
His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. ""How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.""
Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance.
And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling.
""There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages?"" Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma.
""Isn't there a law against this?"" asks his father, equally helplessly. ""How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?""

La La Land, set for release in December, stars Stone as an aspiring actress in Los Angeles who meets a jazz pianist (Gosling) who is trying to stay true to the music he has devoted himself to.
The film also stars singer John Legend and JK Simmons, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor for his performance in Whiplash.
La La Land has enjoyed rave reviews since premiering at the Venice Film Festival in August.
Chazelle wrote the script six years ago but was not able to persuade anyone to make it until he broke through with Whiplash in 2014.
Stone, who won the best actress prize at Venice for her La La Land role, previously starred with Gosling in Crazy, Stupid, Love.
Toronto's Platform prize for international directors was won by Pablo Larrain for Jackie, the Jacqueline Kennedy biopic starring Natalie Portman.

The Royal party are due back in the UK on Friday evening, after a five-day tour that began in Poland on Monday.
On the last day of the tour, the Duchess, who comes from a musical family and played the flute at school, took the musicians through the first notes of Beethoven's fifth symphony.

The Russian state ""is likely to have been the sponsor of this plot"" and had ""reasons aplenty"" for wishing him ""not only harm, but death"", he said.
UK officials believe the two suspects poisoned Mr Litvinenko, 43, in London in 2006 but they deny any wrongdoing.
Mr Litvinenko drank tea containing a fatal dose of radioactive substance polonium-210 during a meeting with Mr Kovtun and Mr Lugovoi.
He died in hospital nearly three weeks later.
The fact that polonium caused his death indicates there was some form of Russian state participation, Mr Horwell said in his closing remarks.
He said: ""The evidence suggests the only credible explanation is that in one form or another the Russian state was involved in Mr Litvinenko's murder.""
However, he stressed this did not mean Russian President Vladimir Putin was involved or gave the order and that there were many possible motives for the murder.
Defecting to the UK in 2000, after accusing KGB successor the FSB of murdering political opponents and of corruption, could have been seen as ""akin to treachery"", he said.
He also spoke of Mr Litvinenko's ""many personal attacks on Putin"".
Mr Horwell has said the risk to the general public in London from polonium radiation will never be known, and also that Mr Litvinenko had been poisoned twice in the run-up to his death.
He said: ""The two attacks on Mr Litvinenko were an outrage. They led to great suffering on his part and eventually to his demise.
""We will never know how dangerous the exposure of polonium to the public at large will be and what long-term effects will be visited upon Londoners.""
Mr Horwell said the suspects left a ""trail of polonium"" behind and they had ""no credible answer"" to the scientific evidence against them.
While the force wanted them tried for murder, this was now unlikely to happen, the inquiry heard.

Separatist and pro-Russian feelings are strong in Ukraine's Crimea region, which is now the focus of the crisis.
Russian MPs say a referendum or a plea from a territory's leaders would be enough to trigger the new provisions.
There are already many Russian citizens in Crimea.
In Sevastopol, base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, a majority hold Russian passports.
Under Russia's existing law, a neighbouring state would have to sign a treaty with Russia to allow part of its territory to become a new ""subject"" of the Russian Federation.
But Mikhail Yemelyanov, deputy leader of A Just Russia, said the law had been drafted for peaceful times, and did not go far enough for situations where a state was falling apart.
""In conditions where a neighbouring state is disintegrating I don't think the Russian Federation should be restricted in its ability to accept a territory whose people have expressed a clear will and desire to be in Russia,"" he said.
Since Russia's war with Georgia in 2008, the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia have come under Moscow's control.
Russia poured troops into both regions to help pro-Russian separatists who did not recognise Georgia's authority.
The other bill to be considered by the Duma - Russia's lower house - would speed up the procedures for issuing Russian passports.
Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required.
In addition, they would not have to have sufficient funds to support themselves and would not have to give up their Ukrainian citizenship.
The bill's preamble says it is aimed ""at supporting the fraternal people of Ukraine, especially the Russian-speaking ones, who are defenceless in the face of the 'brown threat',"" a reference to World War Two fascists who wore brown uniforms.
The bill would allow Ukrainians to apply for Russian passports at Russian diplomatic missions before 1 August, and they could become citizens after two months, instead of waiting a year, as is currently the norm.
The plan to have a new fast-track procedure for issuing Russian passports was announced in Sevastopol on Thursday by A Just Russia leader Sergei Mironov.

Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood.
Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation.
Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow.
But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs.
Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies.
As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than Â£450m a year to the Welsh economy.
But there is a conflict with environmental policy.
Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife.
However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents.
The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed.
It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland.
It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"".
Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry.
He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas.
Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers.

Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) said the claims had no ""clear scientific basis"".
NRW said its figures were based on the ""best available evidence"" it received.
In a briefing note sent to AMs and seen by BBC Wales, TLP disputed NRW's figures and claimed that the regulator refused to share its methodology for calculating them.
""Without clear scientific basis NRW has recently published figures based in these 'what if' scenarios despite our request to consider the evidence needed to back them up prior to publication,"" the briefing said.
""These scenarios give unrealistic and grossly misleading impact figures [on fish],"" the briefing adds.
TLP said that computer modelling carried out by experts on its behalf estimated a ""worst case scenario"" of the lagoon killing 2% of all species of fish.
The Â£1.3bn Swansea tidal lagoon project is being viewed by the firm as a test bed for much larger and more cost effective versions around the coast, including Cardiff, Newport and Colwyn Bay.

Chinese shares fell by nearly 8% after a week of volatile trading that spread fear to global markets.
The Tianjin explosions killed 150 people - with 23 still missing.
A total of 367 people remain in hospital after the 12 August blast at a warehouse where large amounts of toxic chemicals were stored. Twenty are in critical condition, according to Xinhua.
Separately, the UK's Financial Times says Chinese leaders feel they mishandled their stock market rescue efforts.
The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of ""destabilising the market"".
Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.
The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.
The news agency said ""seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II"" were also among the offences.
A journalist was also arrested along with several stock market officials, according to a Xinhua report. The journalist, Wang Xiaolu, is accused of ""spreading fake information"" about the market slump, the report said.
The state news agency said Mr Wang confessed that he ""wrote fake report on Chinese stock market based on hearsay and his own subjective guesses without conducting due verifications"".

0.4,0.0,1.0,['one'],[],10138849,BERTS2S,jk venter is one of the world's most successful scientists.,"The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.
Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying.
And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.
But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.
After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.
Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.
Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.
As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.
This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.
""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said.
During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.
But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.
Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.
He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.
His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do.
The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.
And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.
His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.
Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.
Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.
In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.
But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.
The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.
The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.
""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes.
""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.""",no

It aimed to reach that amount to ""bring to justice those responsible for the war and the deaths of our loved ones"".
The campaign was led by Reg Keys and Roger Bacon, who lost sons in Iraq.
The funding bid began after the publication last month of the long-awaited report by Sir John Chilcot into the 2003 invasion.
Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance
The campaign group initially aimed to reach £50,000 via crowdfunding, but extended its target after raising that figure in nine hours on the CrowdJustice website.
It has now received enough backing to fund the whole campaign.
Mr Keys and Mr Bacon said in a statement: ""This is great proof of the underlying support from the British people in our quest for answers and for justice.
""It is startling and humbling at the same time.""
The money raised will allow the group's lawyers, McCue and Partners - currently working free of charge - to analyse the 2.6 million-word report by Sir John and prepare ""a comprehensive opinion approved by expert senior counsel"".
This would provide guidance on whether legal action against key people involved in the invasion of Iraq would succeed or not.
The Chilcot report did not make any findings on whether individuals acted unlawfully.
However, it rejected the legal basis for UK military action, and said then-prime minister Mr Blair overstated the threat posed by then-President of Iraq Saddam Hussein and sent ill-prepared troops into battle.
Chilcot report: Coverage in full
Mr Blair has apologised for any mistakes made, but not the decision to go to war itself.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars.
MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.
This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau.
The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems.
The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.
Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.
The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.
The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.
Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""

The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.
Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.
The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.
Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.
But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.
The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.
The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.
Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.
But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.
Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.
But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.
And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.
Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.
""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said.
A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.
It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.
The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.
Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"".
About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.
Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.
It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.
Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.
Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.
Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"".
The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"".
Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.
The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.
""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.",no

Although his family achieved success in opal trading, their greatest discovery has been seen rarely by the public.
That has just changed.
The 998g (35.2oz) opal, valued at nearly A$900,000 (Â£550,000; $680,000), is now on display in Adelaide's South Australian Museum.
Still largely in its original condition, the opal's two polished faces reveal a kaleidoscope of colours from green to yellow to red.
""When my father was alive, it was originally kept separately from all trading because it was such a significant piece,"" Alan Bartram told the BBC.
""We decided we would retain that intention, and keep it as a significant and obviously excellent example of light opal from South Australia.""
The family has decided to pass it on for future generations to enjoy.
The museum's director, Brian Oldman, said the opal's rarity should not be underestimated.
""Opal of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions,"" Mr Oldman said.
""When our state's inland sea evaporated millions of years ago, it provided a unique silica-rich environment for the creation of precious opal. It is these exceptional conditions that created the Fire of Australia.""
A mining town for more than 100 years, Coober Pedy still draws people lured by the hope of striking it rich.
""They're becoming more scarce because the overheads of mining now are getting to be so expensive - in fuel, explosives, machinery and living costs on the field,"" Mr Bartram said.
""But South Australia supplies about 90% of the world's quality opals. There may be more major finds.""

Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of killing two-year-old James in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993.
Mrs Fergus said she believed Venables was capable of harming other people if he was released from prison. He was recalled to prison in 2010.
He had been released from prison in 2001, having served seven years of a life sentence, but was recalled when he pleaded guilty to downloading and distributing indecent images of children.
Mrs Fergus, speaking to the BBC to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing, said: ""Do not release him. I still don't think he's capable of walking amongst other people.
""He will do someone else harm. It's in him, and I strongly believe if he's released he will go on to hurt someone else.""
Thompson, who was also released in 2001 after eight years in detention, was given a new secret identity and address.
Venables was aged 10 when he and Thompson abducted and murdered James, beating him with bricks and iron bars and leaving his body on a railway line.
James' mother described it as ""a stupid, silly little mistake"" of hers to let go of her child's hand for a few seconds on 12 February 1993 at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle.
She said it ""still feels so raw to this day"".
""I still can't understand how it happened, or why it happened.""
Mrs Fergus set up a charity, named after her son, to support young people who have become the victims of crime, hatred or bullying.
Asked if, after 20 years, she should move on, Mrs Fergus said: ""Why should I let it go? They took the most precious thing away from me. I won't let it go. And I've always said if there's a fight there to be fought, then I'll fight it for James.
""If I let go of that now I will feel I've let James down.  That is something I'll never do, I'll never let James down. I want justice for James. He's never had justice.""
She has campaigned to have both men kept in prison, and said: ""I did warn [the authorities] that one of them or both of them would go on to reoffend, and I was proven right with Venables.""

James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead.

The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.
At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.
Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.
It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.
The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.
Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.
Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.
Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.
Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.
Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.
Vettel said: ""The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.
""I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.""
Button said: ""It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.
""When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.
""It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.
""But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.""

Although Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer.
Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's ""future is in his own hands"" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel.
These come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso.
Ferrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes.
Raikkonen said: ""I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know.
""Somehow I end up every year in the same position, and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not. There is no contract, but there is an option now.
""I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen, and it is to be here next year.""
If Bottas leaves and Button stays at McLaren, Williams may still look to McLaren's driver pool for a partner for Felipe Massa, on whom they have an option and is expected to stay.

Stubbs, 44, decided to return to England shortly after ending Hibs' 114-year wait to win the Scottish Cup.
""They fitted in with my ambition,"" Stubbs said of Rotherham.
The Englishman has signed a three-year deal with the Millers, who reached a settlement with Hibs over compensation for Stubbs and his assistant, John Doolan.
""Alan and his staff have done a magnificent job, with the pinnacle obviously being that historic Scottish Cup win for which every Hibernian supporter is thankful,"" said Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster. ""We wish them every success in the future
""The task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland's top flight by winning the Championship this season.
""We expect high calibre candidates, and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation, as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say.""
Speaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium, Stubbs admitted it was a ""really difficult decision"" to leave Hibs, but that moving to the Championship in England was ""the next chapter"" for his career.
Rotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart.
""I was impressed by what the chairman had to say, what his vision is for the club and the ambition,"" he explained.
""The club's had two seasons where they've stabilised in the Championship and we're looking to take the club forward. We want to be moving up the table and ultimately we want to be a club that is around the play-offs. That has to be the aim.

""The plan has always been to be the best I can. I wanted to manage at the very top level. I got a great opportunity at Hibernian, they've been fantastic with me, I really enjoyed my two years there.
""I'm glad I've been able to leave on the back of a successful end to the season but now it's a new chapter and one that's very exciting for me.""
Stewart insisted that, despite lengthy talks with Hibs over compensation - and Stubbs and Doolan ultimately resigning from their posts - relations between the two clubs were fine. And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club.
""Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs,"" Stewart said. ""My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment. We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely.

Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of killing two-year-old James in Bootle, Merseyside in 1993.
Mrs Fergus said she believed Venables was capable of harming other people if he was released from prison. He was recalled to prison in 2010.
He had been released from prison in 2001, having served seven years of a life sentence, but was recalled when he pleaded guilty to downloading and distributing indecent images of children.
Mrs Fergus, speaking to the BBC to mark the 20th anniversary of the killing, said: ""Do not release him. I still don't think he's capable of walking amongst other people.
""He will do someone else harm. It's in him, and I strongly believe if he's released he will go on to hurt someone else.""
Thompson, who was also released in 2001 after eight years in detention, was given a new secret identity and address.
Venables was aged 10 when he and Thompson abducted and murdered James, beating him with bricks and iron bars and leaving his body on a railway line.
James' mother described it as ""a stupid, silly little mistake"" of hers to let go of her child's hand for a few seconds on 12 February 1993 at the New Strand Shopping Centre in Bootle.
She said it ""still feels so raw to this day"".
""I still can't understand how it happened, or why it happened.""
Mrs Fergus set up a charity, named after her son, to support young people who have become the victims of crime, hatred or bullying.
Asked if, after 20 years, she should move on, Mrs Fergus said: ""Why should I let it go? They took the most precious thing away from me. I won't let it go. And I've always said if there's a fight there to be fought, then I'll fight it for James.

The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers.
It found ""no support"" for the ""reticent female"" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money.
For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females.
When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found.
The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype.
When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications.
The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.
Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.
""The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.""
He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women ""were more straightforward and tell their friends"".
""Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,"" Prof Oswald added.
""It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.""
The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.
Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.""",no

Close friend Peter Clifford, a lawyer, told the inquest he had ""no reasonable doubt"" that Barry was murdered.
Ms Ziuzina, known as Anna, was 19 years younger than her husband. She tried to claim his assets within days of his death.
His family believe he was killed in a staged hit and run accident.

She said: ""We are sure Anna had some involvement in his death to inherit his money and property.
""I was quite surprised how cold she was with Barry. She did not lift a finger, she was a lazy thing.""
The inquest heard Ms Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account.

Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year.
A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said.
It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted.
The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them.
Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.
NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short.
The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be.
And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.
The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.
NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.
Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work.
It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35.

Unveiling plans for a change in legislation at the Police Federation conference in Bournemouth, Mrs May announced the government proposal that the minimum term for killing an officer should be increased to life without parole.
The current minimum sentence for a police murder is 30 years.
By Danny ShawBBC home affairs correspondent
Theresa May's whole life tariff for police murderers is being welcomed by rank-and-file officers - but it's unlikely to quell the anger felt by Police Federation members about the government's programme of cuts and reforms to the service.
High on their list of concerns is an idea, currently the subject of negotiation, which would allow chief constables to make police compulsorily redundant.
Officers say chiefs could get rid of officers they don't like or those approaching pension age - and with no industrial rights there'd be nothing police could do about it.
A final decision on whether the home secretary will go ahead is expected in the summer. The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea.
The home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was ""a particularly appalling crime"".
""We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us,"" she said.
""And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent.""
She added: ""We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.""
The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences.
In this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated.
The Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder.
A spokesman said: ""Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council.""
But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in.
The Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases ""if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison"".
There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and ""Yorkshire Ripper"" Peter Sutcliffe.
The home secretary, who faced a question and answer session after her speech, was heckled at last year's conference after she told officers to ""stop pretending"" they were being singled out and would ""have to make their share"" of public spending cuts.
Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, who had earlier welcomed Mrs May's sentencing plan, told her morale was low as a result of the government's programme of cuts and reforms.
Speaking at the conference, he urged the home secretary not to ""hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers"".
The biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance, which are currently subject to negotiation.
Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables, was also due to address officers.
On Tuesday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the three-day conference that government plans to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant agreement would make it harder to catch criminals who went on the run abroad.",no
0.4,0.0,1.0,['french'],[],16025568,TranS2S,french scientists say they have found a way to hide the earth's vast mountains of mont blanc.,"In the late 1960s/early 1970s, the ice fields slipping down Mont Blanc and the surrounding mountains of the European range covered some 375 sq km.
By the late 2000s, this area had fallen to about 275 sq km.
The research has been presented at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting, the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists.
It mirrors some findings of retreat occurring in other sectors of the Alps which sit across the borders of several nations, but predominantly Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, Germany, France, and Italy.
The new French Alps glaciers inventory was produced by Marie Gardent, from the University of Savoie, and colleagues.
It assessed the roughly 600 glaciers in broad areas incorporating the Ecrins, Belledonne, Vanoise, Ubaye and Grande Rousse Arves massifs, as well as the famous Mont Blanc Massif in the north.
The team drew upon map archives, past satellite imagery and aerial photographs.  Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.
""We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier,"" explained Ms Gardent.
""Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.""
The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.
By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.
Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.
This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.
""The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps,"" Ms Gardent emphasised.
""We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.""
The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.
Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.
At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.

Passport applicants would not have to pay a state tax, and previous residence in Russia would no longer be required.

Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion.
As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work.

The minister allayed fears about job losses in a letter to Swansea East AM Mike Hedges.
Mr Hedges said the minister's response would ""give comfort"" to DVLA employees.
Concerns over the future of some of the 5,000 workers at the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency centre were raised in October after Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement.
The chancellor announced that the tax disc would be replaced with an electronic system in October 2014.
The new system will allow people to pay the charge by monthly direct debit.
Mr Hedges had written to Mr Hammond asking for clarification of the government's intentions.
In his response to Mr Hedges, Mr Hammond said: ""It is likely that the introduction of a direct debit scheme may mean there will be a natural reduction in the amount of refunds received, in addition to the withdrawal of the tax disc.
""This may mean changes to job roles and the need to train on new processes.
""Any reductions in numbers of people needed for these activities will be managed through redeploying to other growth areas of the business.""
Mr Hedges welcomed the minister's assurances.
He added: ""Whilst disappointed that the changes will reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA, I can see the advantages of both paying by monthly direct debits and not having to show a tax disc.
""I am pleased the minister is committed to redeployment rather than redundancies and I am sure this response will give comfort to many concerned DVLA employees.""",no

Last year £3.6bn was spent on agency staff, but the regulator wants that brought down by £1bn by the end of this financial year.
A cap was introduced in October and has so far saved £600m, the regulator said.
It means hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services should not be paying more than 55% above normal shift rates for any staff, from doctors and nurses to administration staff. Only senior managers are exempted.
The aim was to reduce the overall cost of agency staff as well as getting hospitals to reduce their reliance on them.
Agency staff are more expensive because the NHS has to cover the agency fees and employers costs, such as National Insurance contributions, when it buys them in.
NHS Improvement said the progress being made was ""promising"", but it still leaves the NHS short.
The latest accounts suggested NHS trusts were 10% down on where they wanted to be.
And while the agency bill is falling it is not yet clear whether spending on other parts of the pay bill has risen.
The figures released by NHS Improvement do not cover NHS ""bank"" staff - effectively the health service's in-house agency - or money spent getting employed staff to do overtime.
NHS Improvement said it would start publishing ""league tables"" of the best and worst-performing trusts on agency spending later this year.
Information on the 20 highest-earning agency staff per trust would also be collected amid suspicion some people are still earning large sums from agency work.
It found examples of hospitals being quoted double the rates for doctors. In one case a trust was quoted £130 an hour for a surgeon when the cap is meant to be £76, while another was quoted £70 an hour for a junior doctor when the fee is meant to be £35.
NHS Improvement chief executive Jim Mackey said: ""The NHS simply doesn't have the money to keep forking out for hugely expensive agency staff. There's much more to be done.""",no

Following her surprise return to Albert Square, Dame Barbara announced her character would be killed off.
Her character reappeared on Friday, having left in 2010, to tell her eldest son Phil, played by Steve McFadden, that her cancer had returned.
After the episode, producers revealed that Peggy would die from the disease in emotional scenes to be screened in the spring.

He was involved in repeated family dramas including having an affair with his brother's wife, Kathy, and having his brother go on to marry his ex-wife Sharon.

He was taken to hospital with a deep laceration to his shin and puncture wounds to his calf, but said he would not be put off playing golf.
He told ABC News he would try not to hit balls into the water in future.
Crocodiles are a common sight on the golf course, Australian media reported, and signs warn players of the dangers.
Police Senior Sergeant James Coate told ABC that the 1.2m (4ft) saltwater crocodile had been in a waterway on the 11th hole
Mr Lahiff, speaking from Cairns Hospital, said he had seen crocodiles there before and ""should have realised to be a bit more aware"".
""I didn't see the croc sunbaking just on the edge of the water. I walked past it and then it got me on the way back and as soon as it grabbed me it took off into the water.""
He manage to drive himself back to the club house to get help.
The Australian newspaper reported that wildlife officers would try to remove the crocodile and relocate it to a crocodile farm or a zoo.
But Mr Lahiff told ABC he wanted the croc to stay where it was. ""I think he got more of a fright than me. He's alright,"" he said.
The Palmer Sea Reef golf course is owned by Australian billionaire and politician Clive Palmer.
After the incident he tweeted that he wished the golfer a speedy recovery.

0.7,0.5,1.0,['first'],[],37576755,TConvS2S,people in the uk are being encouraged to sign a virtual reality film for the first time.,"But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them.
Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers.
The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.
Surveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.
In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.
The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.
Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will ""help the public understand a little more about autism"".
The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.
The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.
Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.
A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.
Virtual meatballs
Virtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.
In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.
Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, ""not a typical Ikea customer"" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.
""In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,"" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.
""And what they wanted was meatball,"" she said.
Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.
When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: ""I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.""
""This is really talking to customers,"" said Ms Franov.
Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.
Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.
Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.
Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.
Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately ""democratise medicine"".
Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.
In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.
In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.
The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.
Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they ""were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me"".
Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.
Users can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.
Mr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.
""We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,"" he said.
It is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.
""It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,"" he said.
At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.
""One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,"" he said.
Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.",no

Shortly after Bryson hit the crossbar, Darren Bent added a third when he headed home from close range.
Ipswich struggled for clear-cut chances, while Derby missed several.
Ince, whose earlier effort came after he drifted in from the right to score his 11th goal of the season, could only hit the post from a low cross by Bent in the second half.
Ipswich keeper Bartosz Bialkowski also made smart saves from both Bent and Jacob Butterfield.
The hosts had a late penalty appeal when Grant Ward went down in the area, shortly before Kieffer Moore's shot was deflected wide on his home debut.
The result leaves the hosts with just one win from their last seven games, a run which included being knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincoln City.

""It's quite clearly a foul in the build-up, which is not irrelevant because at 2-0 we could maybe get back in it, but 3-0 has put the game to bed.""
Derby manager Steve McClaren: ""We should have scored more goals, but you can't have everything. I thought we were great in the first half - we've been so disappointed with our starts over recent games.
""There were some tremendous performances and to come here and win 3-0 means the credit has to go to the players.

Many of those questioned seemed to favour going beyond the Smith Commission proposals, which suggested that Holyrood should control income tax rates and bands as well as some welfare benefits.
Give Holyrood full control of income tax 6.8
Increase top rate of tax to 50p 7.2
Increase minimum wage to £7.85 8.2
The most popular of the policy statements in this category was that of giving Holyrood the power to increase benefits and old age pensions, which scored 7.3 out of 10 on the scale.
Close behind was the notion that the Scottish Parliament should have full control of welfare benefits, with a score of 7.1.
Scots appear to place a greater emphasis on embedding and extending powers at Holyrood parliament than on holding a second independence referendum.
When asked to give a score of between 1 and 10, where 10 is an important priority and should be done quickly, each of the four issues relating to additional powers for the Scottish Parliament achieved high average scores.
Giving Holyrood power to increase benefits and pensions achieved an average score of 7.3 out of 10, a little higher than devolving full control of welfare benefits (7.1), full control of income tax (6.8) and full control of all policy other than defence and foreign affairs (6.5).
Interestingly, analysis shows that, for each of these issues, support is higher among groups who are more likely to have voted 'Yes' in last year's referendum.
Read Mark's analysis of the poll.
The idea that Holyrood should have full control of income tax was given a score of 6.8.
Still popular, but a bit further down the ranking with a score of 6.5, was the suggestion that Holyrood should control all areas of policy apart from defence and foreign affairs - what most analysts call full fiscal autonomy.
The results of the poll suggested that voters would rather have a referendum on whether or not to leave the European Union than another referendum on Scottish independence.
Voters gave the policy statement ""hold another referendum on Scottish independence within the next five years"" a score of 5.6 out of 10.
Cap amount paid in welfare to a household 6.3
Limit numbers coming to live in UK 6.3
Give Holyrood full control of welfare 7.1
The policy statement ""hold a referendum to ask people whether they wish to stay in or leave the European Union"" was slightly more popular, with a score of 6.1 out of 10.
The idea of stopping immigrants from the rest of the European Union from claiming welfare benefits until they have been in the UK for four years scored 6.8.
The policy of putting a limit on the number of people coming to live in the UK was less popular, with a score of 6.3.
As ever, how much the next government should spend and how much it should tax is proving to be one of the central issues of the UK general election campaign.

So what are Bernie's supporters doing differently to bolster his support amongst younger voters? One place where he is a surprising hit is the dating app Tinder.

""He's a hit because there's a lot of millennials on the app and he polls amazingly with them"".

""Gender inequality, low wages, high student loan debt, climate change, these are the things that 18-30 somethings are concerned with.""
Nelson Evans, a Bernie Sanders supporter from California, told BBC News that the popularity of Bernie on social media was because his supporters didn't think their candidate received enough attention in traditional media.
""There's people who even pay the full Tinder membership fees in order to reach others across the country"" he said.
""I think it's effective because, prior to the Iowa caucus, the media has completely shut Bernie out of the news cycle. For every 81 minutes of election coverage he'd get 10 seconds and Bernie supporters know that.""
""But people who get their election news from the mainstream media, they have no idea what Bernie is all about. That's sort of what started the Tinder thing.

A World Anti-Doping Agency commission report has accused Russia of running a ""state-sponsored"" doping programme.
And Warner said he feels sports other than athletics have reason to be concerned at how Russian sport is run.
""This iceberg spreads in two different directions,"" he said. ""I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with.""
Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean.""
""They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out.""
Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations.
The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.
Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position.
Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: ""There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way.""
Russia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada,
Igor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: ""There is always room for improvement.
""We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this.""
Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem.
He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF.
The 323-page report said that ""acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread"" in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.
The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were ""sabotaged"" by ""widespread inaction"" against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Pound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was ""worse than we thought"", adding that ""it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system"".
Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition ""until they put their house in order"", adding: ""If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp.""
He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that ""athletics has probably got some other nations to root out"".
He added that while ""there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics"", he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world.
During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: ""I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia.""
On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of ""darker days to come"".
He said: ""This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out.
""There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore.
""We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew?
""No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.""
Coe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as ""alarming"" and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation.
The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be ""inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles"".
Media playback is not supported on this device
It has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as ""a declaration of war on my sport"" in August.
On Monday, Coe said that ""if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them"".
But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.
""This cannot be a one-man crusade,"" Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation.
""We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.
""It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.""",yes

""It's two different worlds. The guys at work can't believe what I do in my Star Wars time and all my Star Wars friends can't believe I'm a police officer.""
The idea to redecorate the Darth Vader costume began when he attended an overseas Star Wars convention.
He originally intended to attend the event as a Stormtrooper with an Australian flag cape. But at the suggestion the idea evolved.
""One of my mates said: 'Why don't you go out and spray paint the entire costume?' I thought - instead of doing a Stormtrooper why not Vader?""
The Down Under alter ego of the Sith Lord has since become a huge hit - at home and abroad.
""I don't know whether Aussie Vader is a villain or a Rebel,"" he laughed. ""I'm a bit of a Rogue One myself.""
""One of my favourite sayings is 'May the Force be with you, mate,'"" he said.
""The cape is an Australian flag. I've got beer cans on my belt and blue flames airbrushed onto my helmet and chest piece. I've even made a custom light-sabre with a didgeridoo handle.""

Eighth-tier Taunton were playing their ninth game in this season's competition and were the lowest-ranked side left after Westfields' exit on Monday.
Centre-half Ed Palmer drew them level with a superb free-kick in the 73rd minute, cancelling out a fine 48th-minute opener by Barrow winger Williams.
But the hosts went back in front within two minutes when a Ryan Yates cross appeared to be deflected into his own net by Josh Searle, and that was enough to send the National League side into the second round for the first time since 2012/13.
Taunton frustrated the hosts in the first half, with Barrow defenders Nick Anderton and Danny Livesey both having headers cleared off the line in quick succession.
Williams then fired wide while Palmer had a free-kick deflected over.
But Williams then latched on to a poor clearance to cut inside and curl a superb right-footed effort into the top corner from 20 yards.
Palmer stunned the home crowd by curling a 20-yard free-kick into the top corner.
But Barrow soon restored their lead and keeper Lloyd Irish prevented Ross Hannah, Richie Bennett and Williams making the victory more emphatic.

Sources close to the deal say Ferrari and Williams have discussed Bottas's transfer but have no agreement yet.

He made his F1 debut for Williams in 2000 before moving on to Benetton/Renault, BAR - which became Honda and then Brawn - and finally McLaren in a career in which he has won 15 grands prix.
McLaren have not yet decided who they will pick to drive alongside Fernando Alonso in 2016.
The team have a contractual option to retain Button, which means that the 2009 world champion cannot join another team unless McLaren decide not to keep him - or fail to decide until after whatever date is set in the contract as the team's deadline to do so.
Their other options are their Danish reserve driver Kevin Magnussen, who raced for McLaren alongside Button in 2014, and the Belgian rising star Stoffel Vandoorne, who is leading the GP2 championship. McLaren have contracts with both men.
Williams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future.
""I've had a lot of questions thrown at me about what I am doing next year but I have not thought about anything, seriously,"" the 35-year-old said.

Bottas, on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons, said he ""did not know"" whether he would be at Williams next season.
""Nothing is confirmed,"" the Finn said. ""We have to wait and see. As a driver, you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait.""
Although Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer.
Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's ""future is in his own hands"" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel.
These come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso.
Ferrari technical director James Allison said this week in an interview with an Italian magazine that Raikkonen was as fast as Vettel but that his results were being affected by the fact he was making more mistakes.
Raikkonen said: ""I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know.
""Somehow I end up every year in the same position, and it makes no difference if I have a contract or not. There is no contract, but there is an option now.
""I have made it very clear to the team what I would like to happen, and it is to be here next year.""

The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed.
""Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out,"" the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left.
""No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days,"" she added.
The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province.
US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out ""nothing short of a massacre"" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva.
""The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people,"" he said in Washington.
John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks.
But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. ""You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,"" he told me.
Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.
Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - ""delusional diplomacy"", the Washington Post called it.
Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.
Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.
A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.
The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.
As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.
The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.
Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.
The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.
The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: ""A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.""
""This corridor is 21km long,"" he said, adding, ""6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.""
Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.
In a televised address, he said Turkey would take ""children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions"".
The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.
UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.
""If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,"" he told reporters in Paris.
The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.
Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.
Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.
In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be ""the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists"", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.
He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.

There have also been warnings that the Spanish government could start charging them for their healthcare.
Speaking to members after the match it was striking how many wanted to get out of the EU and how few had thought about how they might be affected financially.
Whilst one couple worried about their pensions, the others did not seem particularly bothered about being charged for health care; almost all of them had private health insurance.

""It can happen when elephants are frustrated or bored. In my opinion, it's unlikely the elephant was directly targeting the girl - but exhibiting frustration. You can't predict what animals in captivity will do.""

US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"".
What could the US government see?
According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.
The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.
How much do the spooks know?
Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.
""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ€¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he told the Guardian.",no

The charity said online trolls caused misery and humiliation for thousands of children.
Childline's president Dame Esther Rantzen said the figures should be a wake-up call.

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers.
The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International.
All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups.
The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin.
Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.
""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook.
Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.
To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.
The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.
On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.
But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.
On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.
During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.""
Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.
Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.
They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.
In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.
Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"".
What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.
The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.
In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.
And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.
Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia.

Most of the Russian-language report, entitled Putin. War, is based on facts that have already appeared in Russian and foreign media since Crimea was annexed in March 2014 and conflict broke out in eastern Ukraine.
But its authors say putting the facts together and describing the human and economic cost of the conflict makes a very compelling case for accusing President Vladimir Putin of waging war in Ukraine for his own ends.
Russia has consistently denied accusations that it has sent regular troops and armour to help rebels in eastern Ukraine, arguing that any Russians serving there are ""volunteers"".
But Mr Yashin, who presented the report, said Russian soldiers and equipment were decisive to securing all major victories claimed by the pro-Russian rebels in Donetsk and Luhansk.
""All the separatists' key successes were secured by Russian army units,"" he said.
""The soldiers directly admit they were directed on to Ukraine territory, admit that they were brought there to take part in a war operation. There is no doubt they did not end up there by accident.""
The dossier presents evidence of volunteer soldiers who admit that it was Russian generals, not separatists, who directed the main battles in eastern Ukraine.
A Russian army veteran, described as helping to enlist volunteers, says they are not doing it for nothing: salaries can reach $2,000-3,000 (Â£1,250-1,900) a month.
Russian spending on the conflict is calculated at 53bn roubles (Â£665m; $1bn):
Boris Nemtsov began work on the report early this year, after hearing that the relatives of dead Russian soldiers had not been given promised compensation.
But those relatives never went public and, after his assassination, have become even more scared.
Names and numbers of military units are documented, along with photos of weaponry, although activists point out these are harder to verify without knowing where they were taken.

Mr Yashin said the opposition would seek donations to extend the initial print run of only 2,000 copies.
But publishing and distributing this kind of dossier is hard work. Many publishers were afraid to work with this material, he said.
And above all, the question remains: How many people are keen to learn the facts which for months have been available on the internet and the few liberal media that remain in Russia?
There are plenty of Russians aware of their country's involvement in eastern Ukraine, who nevertheless find it acceptable, because they believe Moscow is supporting those who wish to be independent of the government in Kiev.
But the opposition does not see it as support. It accuses President Putin of masterminding and directing the war to boost his failing popularity.
In this, they admit he was successful.
And it is entirely possible their report may well see the same fate as earlier works published by the late Boris Nemtsov.
Critics of Mr Putin praised Mr Nemtsov's reports on corruption in the president's entourage and on the true cost of the 2014 Sochi Olympics.

""This is an invitation which I fear most broken hearts will not be able to refuse.""
If you name the person your husband or wife committed adultery with, they become part of the court case.
They will be sent copies of the paperwork and given a chance to respond. If they don't respond, proceedings may be delayed and could incur more costs.
According to the latest statistics, there were just over 100,000 divorces granted in England and Wales in 2015.
Adultery was the reason for 12,148 of them. ""Unreasonable behaviour"" accounted for 46,815.
Ms Hamblin said 80% of the new clients she deals with in matters of adultery ""want to get the new partner involved and to have their chance to say what they think of them"".
""But it puts the petitioner in a bad light. We have to talk clients down from doing that,"" she said.

The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff.
Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos.
Last month, a £1.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's £1.4bn offer.
Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business.
Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers.
The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.
Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been ""another rather eventful period"" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.
Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.
The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a ""world-leading"" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.
Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.""
Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.
However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos.
Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer.",no

His lawyer has not commented. No date has been set for the trial.
The policeman was sacked a few days later for policy violations.
The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.
""It is important to let our community know that justice is proceeding effectively and thoroughly at the Dallas County DA's office,"" Faith Johnson, the county's district attorney, said in a statement.
The teenager was described by his coach as ""a checklist of everything you would want in a player, a son, a teammate, a friend"".
Roy Oliver faces five to 99 years in prison on the murder charge, the Dallas Observer reports.
If convicted, he would be the first police officer convicted of murder in Dallas county since 1973, the report adds. He is currently free on bail.
Lee Merritt, a lawyer for the Edwards family, said on Twitter: ""We remain cautious. A murder indictment for Roy Oliver is appropriate but the fact is it's been [more than] 40 years since a cop was convicted in [Texas].""",no
0.4,0.0,1.0,"[""the bank of england's"", 'the bank of england', 'mark carney', 'the end of the year']",[],37838086,TConvS2S,"the bank of england's governor of the bank of england, mark carney, has announced he will step down at the end of the year.","After weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.
Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.
Extend, yes, but for just one more year.
Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.
Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?
Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?
Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?
The third, it appears, was the clincher.
When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to ""taking an egg out of omelette""), was a remote one.
But that all changed on 23 June.
Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.
If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.
Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?
That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.
And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he ""wanted to serve"" - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.
But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a ""third way"" - the short extension.
The reasons were personal and unique.
In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.
Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.
For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.
He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.
""To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision,"" he said about whether he would extend his stay.
""No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.
""Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.""
Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of ""tension"" with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.
Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.
Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.
But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.
By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete. It will then be for a new Governor to plot Britain's economic future.",no

The Sweden striker, who is out of contract after four years at Paris St-Germain, could follow former manager Jose Mourinho to Old Trafford.
Football finance expert Rob Wilson says the 34-year-old would be United's most marketable player since Cristiano Ronaldo, and linking up with the three-time European champions would be a ""match made in heaven"".
Wilson says Ibrahimovic's shirt sales alone would help cover the cost of finishing fifth in the Premier League this season and missing out on the riches of playing in Europe's elite competition, worth up to £50m.
""It would not surprise me if Zlatan sold more shirts than Ronaldo or Lionel Messi,"" Wilson, a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, told BBC Sport.
""The cost of missing out on the Champions League is £30-50m. Zlatan will help plug that gap significantly with the number of shirts shifted by United.
""It is a match made in heaven. The football club is commercially so aware who will exploit every commercial opportunity.
""To them, they are signing a player who understands commercial endorsements and behaves in a way that allows him to maximise them.
""Put that together and you get the holy grail stakes of shirt sales, and stacks of corporate sponsorship.
""Zlatan is also the sort of player who brings ad hoc ticket buyers to a match, even if it is the Europa League or League Cup.
""It is matching the world's biggest sporting brands with one of the most marketable players, who has cult following, plus it is his career swansong.
""If you marry that with Manchester United, he will probably shift more shirts in the next year than any player in the squad because of the superstar status that he has.""
Wilson claimed that Ibrahimovic could become the face of Manchester United.
""Zlatan has a global profile, and global appeal,"" he said. ""Fans will buy shirts with Ibrahimovic on the back in Africa, South East Asia - markets United had a foothold in but not the leverage.
""Only a few select few players can do that: Gareth Bale, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.""
If they are the off-pitch benefits of signing Ibrahimovic, what else will the enigmatic Swede bring to Old Trafford and the Premier League?
Since making his debut for his hometown club of Malmo in 1999, Ibrahimovic has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs: Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG, commanding transfer fees of more than £120m.
He has scored 392 goals in 677 games and last season was his most prolific, with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG - while his 38 league goals is also a club record.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Ibrahimovic does not do ordinary goals. He scored four against England in a friendly in 2012, including an amazing overhead kick and then there are the free-kicks, long-range goals, back-heels, flicks and scorpion goals.
Manchester United's FA Cup victory on Saturday was their first trophy since the Premier League title in 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson retired.
But Ibrahimovic is used to regular success and has won 12 trophies in four seasons at PSG, including the domestic quadruple twice.
While he may not have the same Ballon d'Or collection as Messi or Ronaldo, at least Ibrahimovic can console himself with being - beyond doubt - the best player in Sweden.
The striker has won a record 10 Guldbollen (Golden Ball), the award given to the best male footballer in his home country.
Ibrahimovic is one of the most quotable figures in world football. Here are just a few examples:
Johanna Franden, international football correspondent for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, has spent four years in Paris reporting on Ibrahimovic.
""He will play up to that image that people had of him,"" Franden told BBC Sport.
""When he says these things there is still a smile behind it, but for the last 15 years he has had so many people telling him how good he is that I think he does believe all of it.""
Ibrahimovic has always enjoyed a spiky relationship with the media and his critics.
In 2015, after the semi-final of the French League Cup, he ordered his team-mates not to talk to journalists. When questioned why, he said: ""Because I am the boss.""
""Only God knows"" was Ibrahimovic's answer when quizzed by a journalist about Sweden's chances against Portugal in the 2014 World Cup play-offs.
""Well, it's a bit hard to ask him"", the reporter said, to which the player replied: ""You're talking to him now.""
On another occasion, he was forced to apologise for describing France in not so endearing terms.
""There will be a clash [with the media],"" said Franden. ""He will not hold back. He is not scared by the media; he will tell the journalists what he thinks.
""You expect if there is any discontent it will leak out.
""He can handle the pressure, but he keeps his private life private, he does not invite the press in and his partner Helena Seger will be in the limelight more than she has been so far.""
Ibrahimovic could soon be linking up with England captain Wayne Rooney.
In a BBC documentary, he said of Rooney: ""I'd prefer to have him in my team than play against him. I've not been lucky enough to play with him but I enjoy seeing him on the pitch. If I cannot play with him, I will watch him.""
But it is fair to say Ibrahimovic has not always enjoyed the best relationship with team-mates and it is safer to stay on his good side.
He once put AC Milan team-mate Gennaro Gattuso in a bin after a training session, in retaliation for being teased by the Italian.
A fight with AC Milan team-mate and 6ft 5in American Oguchi Onyewu ended with a broken rib for Ibrahimovic, he once threatened to break Ajax team-mate Rafael van der Vaart's legs and another time he hit Mido after the Egyptian threw a pair of scissors at him.
Earlier this year, Ibrahimovic told his PSG team-mates at half-time to ""play as I tell you and everything will be fine"".
""It is a good time for him to go to United, as there is not such a clear leader in the squad,"" said Franden.
""If he goes to United it is because Mourinho has told him he will be the number one, the most important voice in the locker room.
""Zlatan wants to be the most important player on the pitch. He is not a leader in the way he talks, but he expects team-mates to listen to him especially when he is not happy. He is also extremely demanding of himself.
""He will be a good example to the young players in how disciplined he is and how hard he works. He is always early for training and one of the last to leave. He eats healthy and does not drink or smoke.""
Former United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live: ""In some ways Ibrahimovic is the perfect fit for Manchester United at this moment in time. They have young players in the dressing room and he is a leader, a winner.
""He would bring a lot to the club and really put United back to winning ways""
Ibrahimovic is joining United to link back up with Mourinho, who coached him at Inter Milan for a season from 2008-09.
""From being a cat, I felt like a lion,"" was how Ibrahimovic described the impact of Mourinho in an interview with Radio 5 live.
""He was amazing. He dragged out of me things that no other coach has done before. When I played I felt like a Terminator, I felt so confident under him.""
In his book I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he described Mourinho as a manager he was ""willing to die for"".
""The first time he met my partner Helena, he whispered to her: 'Helena, you have only one mission: feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy'.""
""Mourinho knows what he is bringing. Zlatan has always wanted to work with him again,"" said Franden.
""He had been very eager and was disappointed Mourinho had not got him in before.
""He said at Inter that Mourinho was the best he had worked with and was disappointed Mourinho has, until now, not picked up the phone to ask him to come. Mourinho has always praised Zlatan.
""When Zlatan left Inter some players said they were two seconds away from getting physical with each other. There was not enough air to breathe but Zlatan is willing to work with him. They are two big egos and they do clash.""
""If Mourinho lights up a room, Guardiola draws the curtains,"" wrote Ibahimovic about former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who takes over at Manchester City next season.
He referred to the Spaniard as a ""spineless coward"" in his autobiography, and Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed Ibrahimovic said he ""might punch Pep"" during his time at Barcelona.
Barcelona bought Ibrahimovic for £57m and he scored 21 goals in 51 matches, but he felt he was used incorrectly by Guardiola and once confronted him on the training ground over lack of playing time.
""I said I was being used in the wrong way and that they shouldn't have bought me if they wanted another type of player,"" he wrote about a meeting with Guardiola.
""I told him what a friend had said to me: 'You bought a Ferrari but drive it like a Fiat.'""
Expect fireworks at the Manchester derby next season.
Former team-mate Peter Schmeichel said Ibrahimovic could have the same affect at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona, the iconic French striker.
""United need inspirational players, players that stand alone,"" said the former Denmark keeper.
""We had Cantona in the mid-90s. A lot of what happened in the 1990s would not have happened without him. Now it is time to have someone like that again. Zlatan fits that bill.
""In the last five years Zlatan has only improved his fitness, his abilities and output . His stats are unbelievable. Not just say in the French league, because he does it in Europe and for Sweden. He finds the goals, he finds the tricks, he finds what the crowd needs. I said this before, he was born to play for United.""
Ex-United midfielder Paul Scholes added: ""Zlatan joining United does excite me. I know it might only be one or two years at the most, but he is a fit lad, looks after himself and is a great character, he could pull it off without a shadow of a doubt.""
Brazil left-back Maxwell and Ibrahimovic first met at Ajax in 2001 and have followed each other to Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain. They are close friends.
The pair have won 10 league titles together, so could we see Maxwell join his friend across the English Channel?

Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions.
Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas.
Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department.
Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service.
From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions.
So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system?
Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic.
Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres.
He told me the move is ""a huge opportunity for the future, which offers local councils an opportunity to develop their own community and development plans"".
But do Northern Ireland's politicians have the necessary skills?
Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: ""They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference.""
However, not everyone is so upbeat.
Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.
Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.
The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.
James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities.""
Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"".

Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.
Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.
Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.
Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.",no

Stephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.
Stephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.
Our Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.
Stephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.
Profiles of all those who died
Stephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.
When we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.
I started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.
As Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.
He was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.
He used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.
However, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.
When she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.
Angela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.
Stephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.
We had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.
He seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.
We think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.
He finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.
He applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.
He loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.
When Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.
Stephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.
He was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.
He was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.
He could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.
Stephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.
After 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.
Stephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.
Stephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.
Our parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.
Our Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.
We miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day. Thank you.",no

But the Uruguay striker, 27, can now train and play in friendly matches, with new club Barcelona confirming: ""He will join the first team's training session, scheduled for Friday.
""The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou.""
It is not known if he will play in Monday's game with Mexico's Club Leon.
A full explanation of the Cas ruling, which still prevents him from playing ""organised"" matches but now allows him to take part in all ""football-related activities"", will be published at a later date.
He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico.
But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month.
Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment.
Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed.""
But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended.
World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"".
It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment.""
In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities.
His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had ""misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate"".
Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team.""
""By allowing Suarez to train, Cas appears to have taken into account the club's interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate,"" said Hannah Clipston, a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes.
""What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender.""
Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance.
He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.
In 2011, he was also given an eight-match suspension and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.",no

They found evidence of common UK accent changes, such as the use of ""f"" for ""th"" in words like think, and a dropped letter 'l', as in people to peopo.
Overall though, the researchers said the Scots accent remained distinctive.
The three-year Sounds of the City study, was led by Professor Jane Stuart-Smith, director of the university's laboratory of phonetics.
""We were quite surprised by what we found,"" she said.
""The assumption is that traditional dialects generally across the UK are being eroded and some are dying out altogether, but what we have learned, particularly with the Glasgow accent, is that Scots accents are actually flourishing.
""Interestingly, what is not happening in Scotland is the dilution of accents to a more homogenised anglicised accent on the scale that we are seeing in England, and in fact the Scots accent remains very distinctive.""
As part of its study, the Glasgow team built up a digitised body of recorded speech sounds.
The team said its work suggested the distinctive Scots accent had undergone two kinds of changes.
One set are common accent changes, which have spread right across the UK, such as the ""f"" and ""l"" examples.
The team said this change was being spread partly by dialect contact and partly by the popularity of TV shows set in London.
The project also uncovered a second set of finer changes local to Scotland.
These included how vowels were pronounced in words such as boat, goat and coat, or stop sounds that are pronounced in words like pin, top and cat.
The researchers anticipated these sounds either to be stable over time, or perhaps to be changing in the same way as in Anglo-English accents.
Their evidence suggested, however, that these features and others were all changing, the changes were local to Scotland and not affected by Anglo-English changes, and that they had been happening for 100 years or more.
The Glasgow team said the trigger for some of these changes appeared to be the period around the First World War.
The study focused on six audio recordings, made in 1916 and held by the British Library, of Scots soldiers from German Prisoner of War camps.
From those recordings researchers found evidence to show that even a century ago, and perhaps even earlier, Scottish accents were already changing.

The conference aimed to improve on the current tracking system which relies on ground-based radars.
MH370 disappeared in March 2014 with 239 people on board.
Representatives from more than 160 countries decided to set aside a radio frequency for the satellite tracking of planes at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), organised by the UN's International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
The deal will enable satellites to receive transmissions, known as automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B), that aircraft currently only send to other aircraft and to ground stations.
This will allow ""real-time tracking of aircraft anywhere in the world,"" said Francois Rancy, head of the ITU's Radiocommunication Bureau.
The disappearance of flight MH370 exposed weaknesses in worldwide air navigation systems.
The current system leaves around 70% of the world's airspace uncovered.
Soon after the plane disappeared, Malaysia's communication minister urged the ITU to help find new ways of transmitting flight data in real-time.
The Malaysia Airlines flight was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when air traffic control staff lost contact with it.
The plane is long believed to have crashed into the southern Indian Ocean.
In July part of an aircraft wing was found on Reunion Island. Malaysian authorities later confirmed the debris to be from the missing MH370 plane.
Following Wednesday's decision, ITU Secretary-General Houlin Zhao said the agency had ""responded in record time to the expectations of the global community on the major issue concerning global flight tracking.""
The UN's aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), has set a November 2016 deadline for adopting new tracking guidelines.
These will include aircraft sending their position at least every 15 minutes, or more in case of emergency, reported Reuters.",no

Leeds, who slip to third from bottom with just one win from their first six league fixtures, rarely threatened.
Town held on to go four points clear thanks to a fifth win from six.
On-loan Manchester City midfielder Mooy was not certain to play after a hectic international break which saw him appear in both of Australia's World Cup qualifiers.
But he dictated the play as the Terriers had the better of a dull first half in which neither side could muster a shot on target.
Mooy, who was booked late in the first period for a nasty-looking lunge that infuriated Leeds manager Garry Monk and his coaching staff, came closest with a decent low strike.
But his second attempt on goal 10 minutes after the restart proved much more successful and was reward for the visitors' urgency and superior quality.
Chris Wood sent a header wide for Leeds before the break and could have snatched a barely deserved point late on, but failed to properly connect with another headed opportunity.
Leeds head coach Gary Monk:
""I'm disappointed with the result, of course. We went out there with the intention of trying to grab the initiative but partly due to the way (Huddersfield) set up it became a bit of a nothing game.
""We have to get a real reaction now on Tuesday. We need to take the three points, it's as simple as that.
""It's very important that we get this Elland Road monkey off our backs and get the three points.""
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
""There is every reason to be surprised. I don't know which team in this division can say they will start with 16 points after six games.
""We have deserved every one of the 16 points and we said at the start of the season we would play every single game and give ourselves no limits and at the moment we have great togetherness and a very good working attitude, especially in the defence.

Government forces, backed by Russian allies, took nearly all remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo this week.
It represents a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad.
He hailed the ""liberation"" of Aleppo and said history was being made.
Global solidarity over Aleppo
How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo
What's happening in Aleppo?
What happens next?
The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed.
""Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out,"" the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left.
""No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days,"" she added.
The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province.
US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out ""nothing short of a massacre"" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva.
""The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people,"" he said in Washington.
John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks.
But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. ""You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,"" he told me.
Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.
Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - ""delusional diplomacy"", the Washington Post called it.
Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.
Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.
A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.
The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.
As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.
The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.
Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.
The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.
The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: ""A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.""
""This corridor is 21km long,"" he said, adding, ""6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.""
Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.
In a televised address, he said Turkey would take ""children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions"".
The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.
UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.
""If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,"" he told reporters in Paris.
The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.
Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.
Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.
In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be ""the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists"", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.
He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.
Idlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer. It also borders the coastal province of Latakia, the heartland of Mr Assad's minority Alawite sect.",yes

So President Trump's ""Climate Brexit"" was a blow to him - in an ironic twist the fossil fuel company he used to head supports the accord while the government he now represents does not.
It was also a blow to the State Department, and to diplomacy.
How much of a personal setback is not clear because on this, as on other issues, Tillerson kept a low profile.
Twenty-four hours after the decision, the only comment he'd made was an aside at a photo-opportunity. He declared that the US would continue its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and appealed for partners to keep things ""in perspective"".
Tillerson had previously said the US should ""maintain its seat at the table"" on international climate conversations, a sensible position for the nation's top diplomat and one that he reportedly maintained in White House debates on the Paris Agreement.
But publicly he showed none of the passion demonstrated by his predecessor, John Kerry, who powered negotiations on the deal. It seems the president's daughter, Ivanka, took the lead in fighting the corner for the Remainers. And the role of super-engaged interlocutor apparently fell to the climate change sceptic in the administration, Environment Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt, who spoke at the Rose Garden ceremony.
Mr Tillerson did not attend, whether out of resignation or as an everyday-act-of-resistance, we don't know. A State Department official said only that he was in his office and ""maintained his schedule, preparing for his trip today to Australia and New Zealand"".
No doubt Pruitt (and his ally, White House adviser Steve Bannon) had an easier task than Tillerson, given that he was preaching to a president sympathetic to his economic and nationalist arguments.
But the results are another professional blow to the secretary of state. He's already facing a proposed budget cut that looks to gut his department. And the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has even less diplomatic experience than he does, has forged a parallel foreign policy track from the White House.
Clearly, the Paris withdrawal was also bad news for the State Department, which has yet to issue a statement.
Where it once straddled the front lines of global climate negotiations, it's now been dropped off the map.
The US does remain a member of the UN framework for climate change issues, the UNFCCC, but those meetings have become mostly about the Paris Agreement.
Finally, it's a rejection of a monumental diplomatic effort by more than 190 countries over many years to strike all the balances that needed to be struck.
""We have now slapped every country in the world in the face,"" says Todd Stern, the US Special Envoy for Climate Change in the Obama administration.
""We've said we know this matters to you a lot, we know this is a huge potentially epic issue for the world, we know that some of you are particularly vulnerable, but we drop out. It's the worst way you could treat other countries.""
To be fair, this is not entirely untravelled ground - remember George W Bush's decision against ratifying the 1997 Kyoto climate change treaty.
But it is more starkly isolationist, and this is a different Washington - in private chats, international diplomats from across the global spectrum complain that normal channels for getting and giving information at the State Department and White House are still unstaffed. They struggle to find the people who can listen to their concerns or tell them what's going on.
So while this will not break alliances, it could be more difficult to pick up the pieces and say we can still be friends.

The death occurred when police responded to reports of underage drinking at a house party.
Officers were inside the home trying to find the owner when they heard outside what they believed to be gunshots. Roy Oliver fired into a car full of teenagers as they left the party.
Police had initially said the vehicle reversed ""aggressively"" towards the officer, but footage discredited the claim, showing the car driving forward, away from him.
He was also charged with four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon by a public official, in relation to the other four teenagers, including two of the victim's brothers, who were in the car.

Last week, Chinese and Vietnamese ships clashed over the drilling rig that China has placed in waters near the disputed Paracel Islands.
China and Manila are also at odds over overlapping territorial claims.
Beijing claims a U-shaped swathe of the South China Sea that covers areas other South East Asian nations say are their territory.
The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims.
Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig.
Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged.
On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years.
In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry ""said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative"", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
""He urged both sides to de-escalate tensions, ensure safe conduct by their vessels at sea, and resolve the dispute through peaceful means in accordance with international law.""
Separately, in comments made at a meeting with the Singaporean foreign minister, Mr Kerry called the Chinese move an ""aggressive act"".
Mr Wang, meanwhile, urged Mr Kerry to be objective on the issue, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said.
Tensions between Beijing and Manila are also running high, after the Philippines arrested and then charged nine Chinese fishermen with poaching at a disputed shoal.
The Philippines is in the process of taking China to a UN court over its territorial claims.
It has also recently signed a new security deal with the US which would allow an expanded US troop presence, in a move seen as linked to Manila's deteriorating ties with Beijing.

This week she was given a ban and had earlier results annulled after a sample from 2009 was re-tested - but kept her world title.
""She set a personal best with the benefit of drug use,"" Minichiello said.
Russian anti-doping agency punished Chernova with a two-year ban, backdated to 22 June 2013.
It also annulled her results from 15 August 2009 to 14 August 2011 - a period that ended just 16 days before  she won world gold in Daegu with a personal best of 6,880 points, beating defending champion Ennis-Hill's 6,751.
Research carried out by the University of Oslo in October 2013 established that muscles can retain the advantages given by anabolic steroids decades after the point at which they were taken.
Minichiello wants athletics' world governing body the IAAF and the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) to have a ""long, hard look"" at the Russian anti-doping agency's punishment.
The IAAF told BBC Sport it is awaiting a full explanation from the Russian authorities before deciding whether it needs to take any action.
""Maybe it highlights that there is a gap within the anti-doping code which allows only a two-year ban from the initial test and then another ban from the date of the re-test,"" added Minichiello.
""I think it should probably all run seamlessly and athletes should be banned for the whole time. Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective.""
Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
""It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them,"" said Minichiello.
""That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.""
Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences.
Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year.

Prof Ruggles said: ""And then they said to us Alice has been killed. And we looked at each other and said 'It's Harry'. We knew, we knew even then.""
The trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard Dhillon had become obsessed with the 24-year-old and had stalked her.
Dr Hills told of her guilt about trying to reassure her daughter on the phone two days before.
She said: ""And I sort of reassured her that was ok, the police knew what was going on and that it would be all right and if she just ignored him he would ignore her.
""And I only put the phone down for 10 minutes and Emma (daughter) rang and said 'You cannot tell that to her, he's going to kill her. You have got to do something'.
""And I thought she was over-reacting so I just said 'don't be silly'.
""And so of course as soon as I saw the police I knew that's that what it was.

0.7,0.5,1.0,['first'],[],37576755,TConvS2S,people in the uk are being encouraged to sign a virtual reality film for the first time.,"But VR can also be embedded in reality to give people more understanding of the world around them.
Increasingly it is being used as a tool by journalists, teachers, healthcare workers and retailers.
The BBC took a look at a few of the more unexpected uses of the technology.
Surveys suggest that while 99% of people have heard of autism, only 16% really understand what it means. In the UK, more than a quarter of autistic people have been asked to leave a public place, such as a restaurant.
In order to address this, the UK's National Autistic Society made a VR film this summer to show people what it was like to live with the condition.
The film takes viewers on a journey with a young, autistic boy as he walks around a shopping centre. They can experience the sensory overload he experiences as he walks around.
Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society, says he hopes the film will ""help the public understand a little more about autism"".
The film, along with Samsung Gear headsets, was taken on tour around UK shopping centres this summer and the charity is also putting together a pack for schools to teach their students about autism.
The film is available via an app and can be viewed on YouTube.
Alzheimer's Research UK also released a VR film this summer, intended to put the public in the shoes of someone with dementia.
A Walk Through Dementia aimed to show how everyday tasks such as making a cup of tea can be a challenge for someone with the condition.
Virtual meatballs
Virtual reality is becoming a common tool for people wanting to sell something. Estate agents use it to offer customers virtual walks from potential properties while Westfield shopping centre is using VR headsets to show off the latest fashion collections.
In April, furniture retailer Ikea launched an app that placed users in a fully furnished kitchen. Users could change the colours of the units and walk around the space. The app was available through Steam, using the HTC Vive.
Gamers are, said Ikea's Ingrid Franov, ""not a typical Ikea customer"" but the retailer was amazed by the reaction.
""In one month we had more downloads than we had expected for the whole six-months trial and people were asking for more kitchen action,"" she told delegates at the recent VR&AR World Forum in London.
""And what they wanted was meatball,"" she said.
Meatballs are perhaps the most famous dish in Ikea's restaurants.
When meatballs were added to the kitchen, one user told the firm: ""I want you all to know that I have just spent 44 minutes throwing meatballs around a virtual kitchen and I loved every second of it.""
""This is really talking to customers,"" said Ms Franov.
Now the retailer is considering rolling out the VR tool in stores to help customers better envisage how a kitchen design might look.
Healthcare has become one of the big adopters of VR - using it both as  teaching aid and to treat phobias.
Surgeon Dr Shafi Ahmed became one of the first to offer a live virtual surgery experience in April 2016 at the Royal London hospital.
Some 5,000 people in 14 countries tuned in to watch the operation to remove a tumour.
Now the start-up he co-founded, Medical Realities, is launching Virtual Surgeon as a product, hoping that such surgery can reduce the cost of training doctors, reach a much wider audience and ultimately ""democratise medicine"".
Meanwhile, in the US, VR has been used to help soldiers deal with post-traumatic stress disorder and for arachnophobics to overcome their fear of spiders.
In one study, 23 people were encouraged to approach a virtual spider and by the end of the experiment, 83% showed significant improvement in how they could tolerate the situation.
In September 2015, Google launched Expeditions, a program designed to take thousands of school children around the world on a virtual trip - from the Great Barrier Reef to Mars.
The kit, which comprises a Google cardboard headset and an app, has just been launched in the UK.
Most pupils have enjoyed the experience although one Year 3 student told the Times Educational Supplement that they ""were a bit scared of heights so if it could just be on the ground then that would be an improvement for me"".
Marcus Storm is the founder of  VR start-up Evanescent Studios and he is developing a VR app that he hopes will be used in classrooms to improve language skills. The app is currently being trialled at Imperial College, with Mandarin as a pilot language.
Users can watch Chinese people having conversations and visit Chinese landmarks such as the Great Wall.
Mr Storm is enthusiastic about how VR can transform learning.
""We see a future where kids in history lessons are going back to revolutionary France and interacting with the people there,"" he said.
It is a view echoed by Nicholas Minter-Green, president of Economist Films.
""It is bringing the joy to education. The biggest challenge has always been to engage and that is where VR can be a very powerful tool,"" he said.
At VR&AR World Forum in London, he spoke about how Chinese firm NetDragon is testing how VR software and hardware can be used to tell if children are engaged in learning.
""One idea is that headsets could tell when children are tilting their heads, indicating boredom, meaning a change of subject or teaching method is required,"" he said.
Cash-strapped schools may struggle to afford the hardware or the computing power required for VR to run, and Mr Minter-Green acknowledged that there are many hurdles to overcome before virtual becomes a reality, in school at least.",no
0.4,0.0,1.0,"['scottish', 'scottish']",[],26668081,PtGen,the owners of a cat that crashed into a house in the scottish borders have said they are ``upset''by the scottish government.,"The animal had been shot twice in the shoulder and once in its left back leg, which vets had to amputate.
The charity said the one-year-old cat was ""incredibly lucky"" to survive.
Last year the Scottish government held a consultation on licensing air weapons, but a majority of responders opposed the plan.
One-year-old Teenie was found injured by her owner Sarah Nisbett in NiddryView, Winchburgh, at about 16:30 on Friday 14 March and taken to the Scottish SPCA.
Mrs Nisbett said the cat was now having to learn how to walk again.
""The gun that was used must have some power because the pellet actually went through her back leg, that's why it was so badly damaged,"" she said.
""She's now learning how to hop around the house, it's terrible.
""The fact that it was three shots is crazy. We live in a housing estate and there are lots of kids. That just makes it worse because any of them could have been hit in the crossfire.""
She added: ""There's some sick people out there, hopefully somebody will know who's done this and let the police or the Scottish SPCA know.""
Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: ""Teenie's owners are understandably very upset and keen for us to find the callous person responsible to ensure no more cats come to harm.
""This is an alarming incident which only highlights why the Scottish government should implement the licensing of airguns as a matter of urgency.""
He added: ""The new licensing regime should ensure that only those with a lawful reason are allowed to possess such a dangerous weapon. It will also help the police trace anyone using an air gun irresponsibly.""
Last year the Scottish government launched a consultation on licensing air weapons, with a large majority of those who responded opposing the plan.
Under the proposed scheme, anyone wanting to own an air gun would need to demonstrate they had a legitimate reason for doing so.
A total of 87% of respondents rejected the idea - with some describing it as ""draconian"" and ""heavy-handed"". A small number of people felt ministers were not going far enough.
The Scottish SPCA urged anyone with information about the incident to contact them.",no
0.6,1.0,0.0,[],"[('state', 'pass', 'a controversial law which would allow people to be banned from entering the country')]",13569129,TConvS2S,the angolan state of angola has passed a controversial law which would allow people to be banned from entering the country.,"It was scrapped this week at the eleventh hour when the government removed it from parliament moments before it was due to be voted into law.
Under the proposal, which had already passed a first round of voting, it would have been illegal to share information electronically that could ""destroy, alter or subvert state institutions"" or ""damage national integrity or independence"".
This would have meant anyone criticising the government on social networking sites such as Facebook, or receiving an email containing anti-government sentiment, could have faced up to 12 years in prison.
The law also wanted to ban the online sharing of videos, pictures or recordings without the subject's consent, criminalise ""whistle-blowing"" under the crime of ""espionage"" and make it illegal for anyone to search for information about the state, even if it was not classified.
Minister of State Carlos Feijo told reporters in the capital, Luanda, that a decision had been made instead to insert special clauses about internet crimes into the new penal code currently under revision.
But many believe pressure from civil society and local journalists, who had strongly opposed the legislation claiming that it was ""totalitarian"" and violated basic freedom of expression, played a role in the decision to abandon the law.
US-based lobby group Human Rights Watch said the legislation would have ""undercut both freedom of expression and information, and posed a severe threat to independent media, whistle-blowers, and investigative journalism"".
With most of Angola's traditional media controlled by the state, or owned by government ministers and their business associates, there is little free debate in the newspapers or on television and radio.
Opposition parties are rarely afforded column inches or air time, while government and presidential activities are covered in minute detail and nearly always with a positive spin.
Civil society and opposition groups have therefore turned to the internet, even though only 1% of Angolans have access to the web, to hold their debates and share information through blogs and social networking sites.
In recent months, several anti-government marches have been organised and promoted through Facebook, where there are pages dedicated to opposing the president of nearly 32 years, Jose Eduardo dos Santos. There, people make comments they would not dare speak out loud in public.
Angolans living in the diaspora have also been busy online, creating websites to rally support for regime change, and there have been several solidarity protest events held in South Africa, the UK and Belgium.
Many are growing weary of the current regime and want more to be done to share the country's oil wealth among the majority, two thirds of whom still live in poverty and many without access to water or electricity.
The introduction of a special internet law was seen as a deliberate attempt to quash the online discussion that was fuelling this unrest.
In an uncharacteristically emotional speech last month, President dos Santos lashed out at social media sites, saying they were being used to ""insult, denigrate and provoke uproar and confusion"".
Officially the government stuck to its position that the technology legislation was needed to curb crimes such as child pornography, hacking and online financial fraud.
The editor of the private weekly newspaper Angolense, Suzana Mendes, who was among the journalists who publicly voiced concerns about the law, welcomed its withdrawal.
""The fact that the bill has been cancelled is important, because if it had been approved, it would have endangered our fundamental rights to inform and be informed,"" she told the BBC.
Sizaltina Cutaia, from the Angolan office of the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (Osisa), which also opposed the bill, said they were pleased the government had backed down.
""This is definitely a victory for us and it is encouraging that we were able to get our message across."" she said.
However, civil society celebrations around the scrapping of the legislation were short-lived after a number of activists were arrested on Wednesday for taking part in an anti-poverty demonstration in Luanda.
Organised via Facebook by a group calling itself the Revolutionary Movement of Social Intervention (MRIS), the protest was due to take place at lunchtime.
But following the arrest of MRIS leader Luis Bernardo, allegedly detained while putting up posters near his home in the district of Cazenga, only a few dozen people gathered in the city square.
According to reports, between 15 and 20 people were detained, among them a journalist and a representative from Osisa who had been trying to film the arrests.
They were later released and rejoined the protest, which at its height numbered around 100 people.
A spokesman for Luanda's provincial government told state media that the youth involved, who claimed they had authorisation to stage the protest, had acted ""criminally"" and the police force was within its rights to respond.
""What the government needs to realise is that the more they repress people, the more they will want to demonstrate,"" Ms Cutaia said.
Although small in size and number, protests like these are a relatively new phenomenon in Angola where few have dared to question the authority of President Dos Santos and his ruling MPLA.
""The people leading these protests are young and they don't have as much to lose. They were born after independence so they don't have that connection to the ruling party like older generations,"" Ms Cutaia says.
""All they see is that despite Angola's wealth under the MPLA most people have remained poor and they want that to change.
""Most of all they want the right to be able to make their voices heard.""",no

Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.
To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.
The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.
On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.
But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.
On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.
During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.""
Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.
Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.
They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.
In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.
Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"".
What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.
The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.
In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.
And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

US author Sara Paretsky, who created detective VI Warshawski, received an outstanding contribution honour.
The accolades were handed out at the start of the North Yorkshire town's annual crime writing festival.
Shetland and Vera writer Ann Cleeves, this year's festival programming chair, said the crime novel of the year shortlist had been ""really strong"" this year.
The panel had felt Hilary's winning book was ""so finely written and tightly written"", she said.
Someone Else's Skin, a thriller that tackles domestic violence and so-called honour crime, is the first in a series of novels featuring Det Insp Marnie Rome.
""The author was able to conjure up atmosphere in very few lines,"" Cleeves said. ""The subject matter was well done and well plotted.""

VI Warshawski was ""a real game changer"", Cleeves said. ""This was a woman who didn't just solve crimes but was like an action hero in a sense.""
Paretsky ""really changed the way that readers thought about female writers"", Cleeves said.

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said.
For their part, the Lib Dems' Europe spokesperson Baroness Ludford accused Labour of ""waving through the government's plans"" and ""lining up with the Conservatives as they drive forward with a hard Brexit"".
It's not just on Brexit that the two biggest opposition parties have a track record of forming alliances - they have trooped through the lobbies together to impose government defeats on bills dealing with issues from higher education to housing.
Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.""

The electrical and homeware retailer is being targeted by both Sainsbury's and South African retailer Steinhoff.
Both companies have until 18 March to make firm bids for Argos.
Last month, a £1.3bn bid from Sainsbury's for Home Retail was trumped by Steinhoff's £1.4bn offer.
Home Retail recently sold its DIY chain Homebase to Australia's Wesfarmers last month for £340m, leaving Argos as its only remaining business.
Total sales at Argos rose 1.9% to £515m in the eight-week period as demand for furniture and sports goods offset lower sales of electrical goods, such as video games and tablet computers.
The company said Argos opened 90 new stores over the year, bringing the total to 845. The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.
Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been ""another rather eventful period"" for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.
Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.
The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a ""world-leading"" retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.
Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.""
Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.
However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos.
Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer.",no

For decades Fleet Street was synonymous with the nation's biggest newspapers.
Ex-Sunday Express editor Robin Esser said it was once a ""very, very important place"" through which most of the public received its information.
The first British daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, was published in Fleet Street on 11 March 1702.
At its height, ""the Street of Shame"" - as it was dubbed by some - was the pinnacle of a journalist's career, with nearly every national paper and several provincial newspapers having offices within a half-mile radius.
Mr Smith, 43, worked as a feature writer for the Sunday Post and was based in the street for 25 years.
He is quick to point out that the paper's London address is the same as Sweeney Todd's barber shop, where the fictional character took a razor to his clients' throats.
Although the death of journalism has finally arrived here, he says it was announced too soon by some of London's tour guides.
""I was standing by the window once a few years ago, and a tour bus had stopped outside. I heard the guide tell the passengers that Fleet Street no longer had any journalists working here.
""I stuck my head out and shouted: 'We are still here'.""
The street was famous for its many bars and pubs, constantly occupied by journalists both socialising and seeking stories, and Mr Smith tells a tale of once needing to speak to a colleague in the notorious El Vino wine bar - which for many years refused to serve women.
He says he was not allowed in until he squeezed into an ill-fitting jacket, provided by the staff.
""There is so much history here, and to be one of the last ones, I feel unworthy of the torch that I'm carrying.""
Mr Sherriff, 54, has worked on Fleet Street for 32 years, and rose to become the Post's London chief reporter. He says on his first ever day he walked into a smoke-filled newsroom to the sound of typewriters being bashed about.
""The phones didn't even work properly, I'd be amazed if I called someone and it connected the first time.""
His memories of the street in its heyday are of ""watching lorries with large rolls of paper struggling to get down side-streets to printing presses and lots of pubs, filled with journalists and printers"".
""Now it's an endless number of sandwich bars out there. Unthinkable 30 years ago.""
Mr Sherriff describes the atmosphere back then of ""certainly living up to the image you had before you came, but you wouldn't be able to produce newspapers now the way it was done back then"".
Following their redundancy, Mr Smith is becoming a freelance journalist, while Mr Sherriff is taking time out to write his memoirs.
Robin Esser's Fleet Street career spanned some 60 years, during which time he also became executive managing editor of the Daily Mail.
""At its height, Fleet Street was very, very important because television was in its early childhood, and there was no social media. So 85% of information to the public came through the newspapers,"" he says.
""The departure of its last two journalists should be marked, but you have to look forward, not backwards.""
Liz Hodgkinson worked in Fleet Street in the 1970s and 80s and her book, Ladies Of The Street, covers the story of women working there.
""Fleet Street was always more of a concept than an actual street, with papers like the Sunday People, the Sun and the Mail, all in little streets actually off Fleet Street.
""But they were all within walking distance and part of what collectively was known as Fleet Street.
""When I was at the People we'd have a conference at 11am till about noon. Then the editor would open his drinks cabinet - all Fleet Street editors had one.
""Then we'd take a taxi to the Savoy or Claridges for more drinks. We'd come back about 4pm, and then go out drinking again around 5pm.
""The alcohol flowed like water in Fleet Street.
""At the People there were four women in editorial, and 150 men. At the Sun in the late 70s and early 80s, there were about a dozen female reporters and we all sat together in a little room, which was known as the Piranha Pool.
""I was working on an undercover job once for a paper, and rang an editor from a payphone, to check in with him.
""He asked 'Are you in danger, pet?' I replied 'Yes, I am'. To which he replied 'Oh, good.'""
But, like so many empires before it, Fleet Street's grip on power began to crumble.
Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch moved his papers - consisting of the Sun, the now-closed News of the World, the Times and Sunday Times - off to a purpose-built complex at Wapping in east London in 1986. This led to a bitter, year-long dispute which sometimes turned violent, but ended in defeat for the unions.
By 1988, most national newspapers had moved away from Fleet Street to other parts of London, adopting new - and cheaper - computerised printing technology, swapping the merciless screeching of hot metal print for the gossipy whispers of keyboards.
As a result, the buildings they left behind gradually morphed into other uses. The site of Mirror Group Newspapers now houses the headquarters of Sainsbury's supermarkets, for example, and the ""Stab in the Back"" is a Pizza Express.
Now a part of Fleet Street's own story has come to an end, and this infamous era of British history has reached its final deadline.
""As someone who always wanted to be a journalist, and with a keen sense of history as well, just looking at the buildings even now still excites me,"" says Mr Smith.
""It makes me smile, when I think of how I now have that place in history.""",no

But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.
On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.
During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.""
Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.
Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.
They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.
In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.
Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"".
What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.
The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.
In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.
And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

0.6,1.0,0.0,[],"[('rise', 'have', ""a ``popular theory''"")]",37278170,PtGen,"a pay rise in male and female workers has a ``popular theory'', a study has found.","Women are as likely as men to ask for a pay rise - but are less likely to get one, the research found.
The study, by the Cass Business School and the universities of Warwick and Wisconsin, looked at 4,600 workers.
It found ""no support"" for the ""reticent female"" theory, whereby women avoided asking for more money.
For what it claimed was the first time, the study eliminated any impact from part-time workers earning less than their full-time counterparts, by comparing full-time males with full-time females, and part-time males with part-time females.
When like-for-like male and female workers were compared, men were 25% more likely to get a pay rise when they asked, the study found.
The research also concluded there was no evidence for the idea that women were reluctant to ask for a salary increase because they were more wary of upsetting their boss, or deviating from a perceived female stereotype.
When analysing the results, the researchers took into account the size of the employer and the industry, whether the workers were a parent, as well as their qualifications.
The study was based on data from the 2013-14 Australian workplace relations survey. Australia is thought to be the only country to systematically record whether employees had asked for a pay rise, and why they had or had not done so.
Andrew Oswald, professor of economics and behavioural science at the University of Warwick, said he was surprised by the findings.
""The fact that women don't ask for pay rises as often as men is a popular theory. It's a very common thing for women to say and believe, but all of the evidence is anecdotal, so it's very hard scientifically to do a proper test of this.""
He said one possibility was that unsuccessful men who asked for a pay rise, but did not get it, kept it to themselves, while women ""were more straightforward and tell their friends"".
""Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,"" Prof Oswald added.
""It could be that Australia is odd. But it's a modern industrial economy halfway in character between Britain and the US, so I think that's unlikely.""
The study also found differences according to age, with women and men under 40 both asking for and receiving pay rises at the same rate, which the researchers said could mean that negotiating behaviour had started to change.
Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School - part of City, University of London - and a co-author of the study, said: ""The study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior.""",no

Barnet Council apologised for the problems and later offered emergency proxy votes to residents who had been affected.
But voters in the area questioned how the result could be ""fair"" when not everyone was able to have their say at the ballot box.

0.4,0.0,1.0,"['the house of lords', 'uk', 'first']",[],38345826,TConvS2S,the house of lords has called for the uk to stay in the eu for the first time since brexit.,"It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal.
Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign.
The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations.
The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain.
This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June.
Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway.
However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry.
Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"".
What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.
""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access.""
However, that access may come at a price.
""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.
""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.""
The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.
One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.
Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.
Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.
""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,"" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.
""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.""
In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.""
""At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.""

The hosts went close via Harry Pell's volley and Jordon Forster's header.
James Collins and Byram both could have added further goals for the visitors, who made seven changes following top-flight losses at Manchester United and Southampton.

Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere.
On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as ""brutal"".
In an editorial, the newspaper said the ""ruthlessly effective"" policy was ""inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war"".
It said it would be ""unconscionable"" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested.
Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was ""very sad"".
""If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats,"" he told ABC Radio.
""Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats.""

But IS militants, he said, ""boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing"".

Ms Evans' six-month ban for bringing the party into disrepute - claims she has dismissed - means she cannot stand.
She said she would back councillor Lisa Duffy to succeed Nigel Farage.
Ms Evans said UKIP needed to ""break free of its hard-right image and set itself firmly in the common sense centre-ground"" and also conduct some ""internal reform"".
The leadership contest has been prompted by Mr Farage's decision to stand down following the UK's vote to leave the European Union, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"".
In a statement in Westminster, Ms Evans, who had been touted as a possible successor, said: ""I'd very much like to run in that election.
""Unfortunately there are a handful of people at the top of UKIP who, for whatever personal reasons of their own, have made quite sure I can't.""
She claimed the party rulebook had been ""abused"" to suspend her to prevent her from representing the party in May's London Assembly elections and the upcoming leadership contest.
Her six-month suspension handed down in March came after an internal disciplinary meeting found she had publicly criticised a fellow candidate and held herself out as a party spokeswoman without authority.
Ms Evans - who has always rejected the claims against her - lost a High Court bid to overturn the decision.
In the statement, she said: ""I have to face up to reality, there's no way they're going to allow me to put my name on the ballot paper... I've now given up hope of becoming the next leader of UKIP.""
Ms Evans said she had questioned whether to stay on in a party that ""allows, and arguably encourages senior figures to behave like this"", but she said the support from members had made her ""more determined ever not to give up on UKIP"".
She also said that with the right leader, the ""sky was the limit for the party"".

The Welsh government called on Westminster to address the impact of high energy prices on industry.
The UK government has been asked to comment.
Plaid said Gross Value Added (GVA) figures -  which measure the value of goods and services produced - show the so-called foundation industries in Wales have suffered a 39% decline in the five years to 2013.
Mr ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to take action to help industries combat high energy costs.
He said: ""Figures show that the threat to our economy runs far deeper than steel, but affects the range of industries that our economy is built upon.
""This includes the chemical industry, other metals, and wood products. Wales' foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline.""
He said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry.
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government.
""We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem.

""We've had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities.
""But the foundation industries need a lot more support, particularly with the energy costs we have, and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive.""
Economist Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University, said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic.
But he said Wales' growth areas had been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services and the public sector.
""We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales' economic destiny as we'd like to see it,"" he said.
""Of course, on current structures they can't, they simply aren't like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways.
""A back office for a bank simply can't do the same things for Wales, no matter how many bums on seats there are in those call centres. They don't provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision.""

Architects plans show a petal-shaped glass structure at the centre of a Â£1bn development featuring a marina, housing and restaurants.
It also includes fast ferry links to Southampton and Portsmouth.
With an application for outline planning permission due later this year, building could start in 2018.
The oil-fired Fawley Power Station, on the western side of Southampton Water, was commissioned in 1971 and was capable of powering one million homes.
The 300-acre site was sold to Fawley Waterside developers in 2016.
Aldred Drummond of the company said: ""We'd be mad to knock the chimney down - its our signature piece of infrastructure.
""If you think of the money spent building the i360 in Brighton, or the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth, this building is already there so with relatively little investment we can do something very spectacular.""

German authorities have asked the US ambassador for ""swift clarification"".
The US National Security Agency (NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme.
The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden.
The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance.
The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions.
German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst.
The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details.
A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany.
""The matter is serious, it is clear,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper,
Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money.
However, one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily.
""This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee... He was not a top agent,""   the source said.

He worked tirelessly to ensure money was raised and homes were found for the young refugees.
Yet, amazingly, his self-effacing manner meant that it was 50 years before the full story of his heroic efforts became public knowledge.
Nicholas George Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in the well-heeled Hampstead district of north London.
His Jewish parents had moved from Germany to London in 1907 and changed the family name from Wertheim to Winton.
They had also converted to Christianity and it was into that faith that their son was baptised.
In 1923, Winton became one of the first pupils at the newly opened Stowe School in Buckinghamshire. Although he left without attaining any qualifications, he had become imbued with a love of mathematics.
He continued his studies at evening classes before moving to Germany, where he worked in banks in Hamburg and Berlin.
In 1931, just two years before Hitler became German chancellor, he moved to work in Paris before returning to London.
His mother's family had remained in Germany and that, together with the stories of Jewish refugees fleeing to London, made him all too aware of the persecution of the Jews by the Nazis.
In December 1938, Winton had been due to go on a skiing holiday to Switzerland when he suddenly decided to travel instead to Prague, where a friend was trying to help Jewish refugees.
He visited camps for refugees from the Sudetenland, a German-speaking area of Czechoslovakia, which had been ceded to Germany in September 1938 following pressure on the Czech government from Britain and France.
British activists were already working in Czechoslovakia trying to help the refugees, but Winton's great idea was to rescue children by finding families in the UK to give them a home.
He was helped by a 1938 Act of Parliament that permitted the entry of refugee children under the age of 17, as long as money was deposited to pay for their eventual return home.
Winton set up an office in a hotel in Prague, where he was quickly besieged by families desperate to get their children out before Germany invaded Czechoslovakia.
On his return to London, he worked with relief organisations to set up the Czech Kindertransport, just one of a number of  initiatives attempting to rescue Jewish children from Germany and the Nazi-occupied territories.
Winton placed dozens of newspaper advertisements pleading for people to come forward and offer children a home. It was not always easy.
""The problem was getting the people who would accept the children, and of course this was at a time when the evacuation of children from the south [of England] was taking place anyway,"" he said.
""It's marvellous that so many people did come forward. The unfortunate thing was that no other country would come along and help.
""I tried America but they didn't take any. It would have made a vast difference if they had.""
In the first eight months of 1939, eight trains left Prague taking 669 children to safety. A further 15 were flown out via Sweden.
The ninth train was scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland and triggered the outbreak of World War Two.
""Within hours of the announcement, the train disappeared,"" Winton later recalled. ""None of the 250 children on board was seen again.
""We had families waiting at Liverpool Street that day in vain. If the train had been a day earlier, it would have come through.""
Winton registered as a conscientious objector and served for a time as an ambulance driver, before joining the RAF where he was eventually commissioned.
He told no-one about his pre-war exploits and it was not until 1988 that his wife discovered a scrapbook in the attic containing a mass of documents, including the names of the rescued children.
In July of that year, Winton appeared on an edition of the BBC programme That's Life, and some of the people he had rescued were invited to attend.
Until they arrived in the studio, they had no idea that Winton was the man who had saved them.
Winton was awarded an MBE in 1983 for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield care homes and, in 2003, was knighted in recognition of his efforts on the Kindertransport.
In 2007, he received the Czech Republic's highest military decoration, the Cross of the 1st Class, and was nominated by the Czech government for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize.
A train dubbed ""The Winton Train"" left Prague station on 1 September 2009, exactly 70 years after the last Kindertransport had been due to depart from the Czech capital.
In October 2014, at the age of 105, he travelled to Prague to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, the Order of the White Lion.
In his acceptance speech, he was typically modest: ""In a way, I shouldn't have lived so long to give everyone the opportunity to exaggerate things the way they are doing today.""
It was another Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who summed up the vital role of those who, like Winton, tried to save Europe's Jewish children from the Nazis:
""In those times there was darkness everywhere. In Heaven and on Earth, all the gates of compassion seemed to have been closed.
""The killer killed and the Jews died and the outside world adopted an attitude either of complicity or of indifference. Only a few had the courage to care.""",no

The allegations first came to light during a 2012 court case against the firm for trafficking antiquities.
The sculpture of Hindu goddess Uma Parameshvari is thought to have been stolen from a Shiva temple in Tamil Nadu in southern India.
The decision to return the item came after discussions between Singapore's National Heritage Board and the Indian government body looking after its antiquities, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).
The ASI submitted an official request for the return of the sculpture in May, according to the museum.

The Russian LGBT Network, in touch with victims in Chechnya, told the BBC that the report was true.
Homophobia is rife in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus republic. Authoritarian leader Ramzan Kadyrov is fiercely loyal to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
A spokeswoman for the LGBT Network said detainees were tortured with electric shocks and beatings at a prison near Argun, 20km (13 miles) from the city of Grozny.
""All the people arrested are homosexual men or perceived as being gay,"" said Natalia Poplevskaya.
Ramzan Kadyrov has denied the allegations, calling them ""lies"". His spokesman Alvi Karimov said there were no gay people in Chechnya.
The Chechens' spiritual leader, Mufti Salah-haji Mezhiev, confirmed that ""retribution"" was part of the resolution adopted at the special Muslim meeting in Grozny on 3 April.
""There will be retribution!"" he told the Russian news website RBC. ""Allah will punish those who slandered the whole Chechen nation and Chechen Republic's clerics.""
Novaya Gazeta's 1 April report said the detainees included some influential Muslim clerics close to Mr Kadyrov, and two well-known Chechen TV presenters.
In an open letter to the mufti, the paper's chief editor Dmitry Muratov said his journalists would continue investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya.
""We did not insult - nor had we the slightest intention to insult - the Chechen people,"" he wrote, urging dialogue.
Chechens have been linked to two murders of Novaya Gazeta reporters who investigated crimes in Chechnya - Anna Politkovskaya and Natalia Estemirova.
But much remains unclear about those contract killings, and that of Boris Nemtsov, an opposition politician who was shot dead in Moscow in 2015 and also exposed corruption and organised crime in Chechnya.

The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £390m more in spending available to them next year.
Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016-17 spending plans on Wednesday.
The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month's spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11.
Mr Swinney said 4.2% of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20.
He said: ""The chancellor (George Osborne) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, and more than £1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade.
""We have demonstrated that the UK government didn't have to take this approach. Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor.
""Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days.
""Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on.""
Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would ""not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession"".
He added: ""In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level.
""These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government.""
Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: ""The Scottish government will have £390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to £750m if you include its own underspend.
""The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £30bn.
""One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government.

These include basic metals, chemicals and wood.
The Welsh government called on Westminster to address the impact of high energy prices on industry.
The UK government has been asked to comment.
Plaid said Gross Value Added (GVA) figures -  which measure the value of goods and services produced - show the so-called foundation industries in Wales have suffered a 39% decline in the five years to 2013.
Mr ap Iorwerth urged the Welsh government to take action to help industries combat high energy costs.
He said: ""Figures show that the threat to our economy runs far deeper than steel, but affects the range of industries that our economy is built upon.
""This includes the chemical industry, other metals, and wood products. Wales' foundation industries have witnessed a steep decline.""
He said UK government should also work with the EU to ensure maximum flexibility in use of procurement legislation so that they can better protect British industry.
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""No-one has defended the steel industry more than the Welsh government.
""We have raised with the UK government over several years our concerns about the impact high UK energy prices are having on the competitiveness of our industries and again call on them to address this major problem.

""We've had the ability to stay agile and seizing the opportunities.
""But the foundation industries need a lot more support, particularly with the energy costs we have, and we need for the Welsh government and Westminster to get behind them to help them thrive.""
Economist Prof Calvin Jones, of Cardiff University, said the foundation industries were still important in terms of their high economic value and for being iconic.
But he said Wales' growth areas had been in retail, hotels, back-office financial services and the public sector.
""We have to think about how they will fulfil Wales' economic destiny as we'd like to see it,"" he said.
""Of course, on current structures they can't, they simply aren't like Tata which is a company which is incredibly valuable in so many ways.
""A back office for a bank simply can't do the same things for Wales, no matter how many bums on seats there are in those call centres. They don't provide the same jobs or a narrative for the Welsh economy that will give us a future vision.""

The NAC, which sanctioned the bout, told BBC Sport it expected to receive a request from McGregor on Wednesday.
NAC rules state fights at 154 lbs require 10oz gloves and the matter will now be debated on 16 August.
Lighter gloves offer less cushioning for the hands but theoretically lead to punches being more punishing.
Last week Mayweather posted an Instagram message stating: ""I'll be wearing 8oz Grant gloves.""
But the undefeated fighter - who will come out of retirement for the bout - had not submitted a necessary waiver document at that stage. Instead, his team had asked the authorities what the process of using lighter gloves entailed.
At the time, NAC executive director Bob Bennett told BBC Sport he had never seen a move to 8oz gloves at 154lbs before.
Rules state that 10oz gloves are used from 135lbs upwards but bouts between 135lbs and 147lbs can use 8oz gloves if waivers are signed and the NAC feels the move is justified.
""Even if they are both in agreement, our number one policy is the health and safety of the fighters,"" said Bennett. ""To deviate from our regulations at a difference of 7lbs would be for the chairman and commissioners to determine.""
During his UFC career, McGregor has used 4oz gloves and he welcomed Mayweather's Instagram post last week, stating: ""I am coming sprinting at you with bricks. Know that. Brittle hands.""
The NAC will debate the matter publicly before announcing its decision.
McGregor, 29, will make his boxing debut in what could be the richest fight in history. The UFC lightweight champion's move from the octagon to the ring to face Mayweather, 40, has prompted criticism from major boxing personalities such as Oscar De La Hoya and Gennady Golovkin.
But Bennett says he studied a ""litany of information"" on the Irishman before telling his chairman there were ""several reasons to approve the fight"".
Bennett said that McGregor's UFC rival Nate Diaz played a role in him forming his opinion.
""I spoke to Virgil Hunter, who trains many top fighters and has worked with the likes of Andre Ward,"" said Bennett. ""He used Nate Diaz a dozen times for sparring and said he rated him as an outstanding boxer.

0.0,0.0,0.0,['first'],"[('portrait', 'commission', 'the first time')]",34279049,TranS2S,a new portrait of mozart music is being commissioned by the royal orchestra for the first time.,"The oil painting was commissioned by Royal Northern Sinfonia, which wants to challenge the Austrian's ""chocolate box"" portrayal, ahead its new season.
""Somehow we've come to think of his music as pretty,"" said the orchestra's music director Lars Vogt.
""But that music is often dramatic and dark. Those qualities must have been there in the man.""
The portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O'Brien, and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra's home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months.
Regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart wrote more than 600 works, including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music, before he died at the age of 35.
Only 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime, but many are stylised or incomplete.
The best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi, for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni.
""Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent-minded young man, but not without a certain spirit of pride,"" he said. ""He was very popular with the ladies, in spite of his small size; but he had a most unusual face, and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes.""
Describing the existing portraits as ""cosy and pretty"", O'Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting.
""I know of few musicians of real depth where you can't see some of that complexity in the face.  So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration.
""Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger. Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance, and I related to those for Mozart.""
O'Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine, which was inspired by U2 singer Bono.
The portrait accompanies the Northern Sinfonia's new season, which includes a series of concerts called Reclaiming Mozart.
They begin on Friday, 18 September with the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 25, and will also include his Clarinet Concerto and the rarely performed Symphony No. 33.
Musical director Vogt will be the soloist in the Quintet for Piano and Wind, of which Mozart once wrote: ""I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life.""
The German concert pianist and conductor, who recently played the first night of the Proms, is an avowed Mozart fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer's works.
In his first season as director of the Sinfonia, he plans to stage a number of ""pop-up"" concerts in venues that echo the ""darker corners of Vienna"" that Mozart would have frequented in the 18th Century.",no

Park View Educational Trust said it may be removed from running the schools.
Oldknow Academy and Golden Hillock School, also rated inadequate, were warned they could lose funding unless concerns were addressed.
A head teacher at one of the Trojan Horse schools said parents tried to undermine her authority and descended on the school during an Ofsted inspection.
The head teacher, who wished to remain anonymous, said she heard parents speaking to an inspector about her.
She said she came close to quitting her job on a number of occasions but everything ""fell into place"" when news of the Trojan Horse letter broke.
""From 2012 I felt alone,"" she said.
""I did not know it was happening to other heads. If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed.
""I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'""
On Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover.
Five of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate.
'Islamic-themed assemblies'
Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board.
In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were ""deep concerns"" about the way Park View School was run.
The letter said: ""I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement.""
Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote ""spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils"".
""I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations,"" he said.
A similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated.
Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July.
A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels.
They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools.
""What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education,"" they said.
In a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement.
""Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction,"" it said.
Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July.
These included ending ""less favourable"" treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more ""broad and balanced"" curriculum.
Oldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash.
A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale.
Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said ""a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip"" in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an ""organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology"".
'Own agendas'
The report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate.
It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies.
Park View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating.
Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools.
He said there had been ""upset"" among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating.
""This is all about moving forward, what happens next,"" he said.
""Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching.
""When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding.""
Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and accused inspectors of bias.
Health professional Arshad Malik told the BBC the findings were  ""alien"" to his child's experience at Park View.
""â€ŽInspectors came with loaded questions,"" he said.
""People are trying to use this school to push their own agendas.""
He said parents would like to invite Education Secretary Michael Gove to the school for an open meeting about Ofsted's findings and to talk about what evidence was found to support them.",no

1.0,1.0,1.0,[],[],21267591,BERTS2S,the leader of bahrain's main opposition party has said there needs to be dialogue between the kingdom's crown prince and government.,"Sheikh Ali Salman told the BBC that for national dialogue to be meaningful, the government had to show its willingness to offer ""concrete solutions"".
""We want someone who can speak for the royal family,"" he said.
Crown Prince Salman al-Khalifa is seen as a reformist in a court divided on how to respond to opposition demands.
Hardliners - centred around the unelected Prime Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, who has been in his post since 1971 - are said to be opposed to a dialogue process which has only just been agreed between the government and six opposition societies.
They fear that any concessions will only serve to encourage more demands from opposition leaders they deeply distrust.
However, speaking to the BBC during a visit to London, Sheikh Salman insisted that now was the time for dialogue.
""We welcome it, we are ready for it,"" he said. ""We believe that dialogue and negotiations are necessary.""
The al-Wefaq leader acknowledged that many young protesters had lost faith in the main opposition parties.
""A lot of young people do not believe that we should ask for permission to go on a demonstration, or that we should call for a constitutional monarchy with this family, which until now is still killing people"".
But he believed that the only way forward was to work with reformists within the Sunni Muslim royal family, including the US- and UK-educated Crown Prince Salman, who has has long been considered a proponent of accommodation with the country's Shia majority.
Sheikh Salman noted that hours before King Hamad brought in Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) troops to restore order and crush dissent on 14 March 2011, the crown prince and opposition had agreed a seven-point plan that would have moved Bahrain towards a constitutional monarchy.
""We had an agreement with the crown prince,"" he said. ""The seven principles were announced and then 12 hours later, GCC troops came in and severed the dialogue.""
Asked about the appointment of Senator John Kerry as US secretary of state, Sheikh Salman said he was ""hopeful"" that he would ""do more than his predecessor"", Hillary Clinton.
""US policy needs to be more clear and direct. The United States government needs to pressure harder for human rights and democratic practices.  We are told that Mr Kerry has more interest in Bahrain and so we hope he will achieve more.""
On the UK's approach to the crisis in Bahrain, the al-Wefaq leader was more blunt.
""If the UK government and [Prime Minister David] Cameron are serious about putting an end to violence and human rights abuses, then they have to speak out publically.
""It is not enough to say: 'We are privately urging reform.' That has been done for years. Unfortunately, the Bahrain government is not listening to these private conversations.
""So, the question I would ask the British government is: 'Shall you continue to say it privately and not put public pressure?' This is not, I think, a good policy.""
Sheikh Salman also reiterated al-Wefaq's position that it would continue to call for ""peaceful demonstrations"", even though all public gatherings and rallies are currently banned in Bahrain.
""It is the only way open to us to put pressure on the government.""
He also called for the release of 13 opposition leaders and human rights activists who have been sentenced to between five years and life in prison on evidence widely accepted as having been obtained under torture. They were convicted of plotting to overthrow the government.

Two others were arrested and accused of planning to transport the drugs.
On Tuesday morning, US border agents ordered the two men they encountered near the border to halt, officials said.
One of the men dropped his backpack, fired a weapon at the agents, and ran, according to a criminal complaint filed in US federal court in Washington on Wednesday.

The report Homicide in Scotland showed that a sharp instrument remained the most common method of killing in Scotland and accounted for 51% of homicides (29 cases) in 2015-16.
Nearly all of these cases (26 out of 29) involved a knife.
While the majority of the accused had an unknown status for alcohol and drugs, 31% (20 people) were identified by the police as being under the influence of alcohol or alcohol and drugs.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""While it is encouraging to see continued falls in homicide cases alongside the long-term decline in violent crime, the sustained efforts that have helped achieve this - through education and enforcement - must continue, because each of the lives lost is one life too many.
""There is a clear role across a range of public services, in addition to the critical work of our police, to continue to support communities that may remain at risk from violent crime and to challenge irresponsible attitudes both to alcohol misuse and to so-called 'casual' violence.
""We will continue to work with partners and invest in a range of projects to help steer our young people away from the risks of a life of violence and crime, while also ensuring our law enforcement agencies and the courts have the powers and resources needed to deal with those who do harm to others.""
Scottish Labour's justice spokeswoman Claire Baker said: ""Whilst I welcome the overall downward trend in homicides in Scotland we have to take these statistics with a note of caution.
""Last year when the Scottish government were heralding 'record low' homicide figures after a supposed similar drop, the actual figures were being revised upwards to show an increase.
""Meanwhile, sexual crime in Scotland sits at a 45-year high and in the past year we have seen an increase in violent crime with attempted murder and serious assault rising by a staggering 27%.""

But a public fundraising campaign launched in September hit its target in just a month.
Adminstrators Begbies Traynor said the collection will remain on display at the museum in Barlaston, Staffordshire.
The Art Fund, which led the campaign, will gift the collection to the Victoria and Albert Museum, before it is loaned to the Wedgwood Museum.
Administrator Bob Young said it had been ""incredibly satisfying"" to sign off on the sale on Monday.
""Today's fantastic outcome wouldn't have been possible without the spirit of goodwill and determination shown during the often complex negotiations,"" he said.
The Wedgwood Museum inherited Waterford Wedgwood plc's pension bill after the firm collapsed in 2009.

The collection risked being ""sold and scattered around the globe"" had the money not been raised, she added.

And she was again visibly emotional after Mr Salmond told the chamber: ""It's goodbye from me... for now"".
Ms Marwick, Mr Salmond and Mr McNeil are among those standing down as MSPs ahead of the election on 5 May.
Mr Salmond, who served as first minister between 2007 and 2014, used his valedictory address to repeat a belief he expressed in his very first speech in the parliament that Scotland was ""not divided, but diverse"".
He said both the country and parliament were on a journey, and added: ""Yes we are a country of different views, but we are not divided. There is in fact a broad consensus on the need for this parliament to assume greater responsibility for the governance of Scotland.
""And we are definitely stronger - so much stronger - as a result of that"".
He welcomed the transfer of powers to Holyrood under the Scotland Bill, but again insisted the bill did not fulfil the pledges which he said had been made by unionist politicians in the last days of the referendum campaign.
There were lighters moments as Mr Salmond, who was speaking before the Chancellor delivered his UK budget, joked that he was aware that he faced competition from a ""major attraction down south today"".
He then added: ""However, on balance, I feel that the champion chase at Cheltenham racecourse will not be overshadowed by my remarks.""
And the former SNP leader joked that he wished everyone standing in the forthcoming election good luck, ""albeit with varying degrees of enthusiasm"".
He concluded his address by saying: ""Let me leave you with these final thoughts - there is no greater honour in public life than to be a member of this parliament.
""There is no greater task than to mould the public purpose of Scotland. There is no greater cause than to serve the people of this country.
""And so with that it is goodbye from me... for now"".
Ms Marwick thanked Mr Salmond for his contribution both as an MSP and as first minister, and added that he had ""served the parliament and Scotland with distinction"".
The presiding officer had earlier been moved to tears by a powerful final speech by Scottish Labour backbencher Duncan McNeil, who is stepping down as an MSP after serving in the parliament since it was established in 1999.
Mr McNeil used his address to warn that Holyrood had things to learn from Westminster, particularly with regard to the committee system.
He said: ""It will be this parliament's responsibility to ensure there is accountability, there is scrutiny and even opposition when that is necessary.
""We must ensure we are capable of meeting that challenge, or we will face the consequences.""
He recalled how former Labour MP Robin Cook came to Holyrood to look at the lessons that could be learned when it came to reforming Westminster.
But Mr McNeil said: ""It saddens me to say we now have to do a bit of learning from them and how they run their business.""
Former Scottish Conservative MSP Annabel Goldie is also bowing out of Holyrood.

In the 1990s, he was a star player at the University of Nebraska, making him a sought-after rookie in the NFL.
Phillips played for the St Louis Rams, Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers until 1999, but he was plagued by trouble on and off the field.
After his NFL career, Phillips continued to have problems with the law.
Eventually, he was sent to prison after being convicted of assault for driving his car into a group of teenagers.
In another case, he was convicted of assaulting a former girlfriend.
Phillips, who was serving a term of more than 30 years, had been placed in a cell alone after he was accused of killing his former cellmate.

Those who have registered an interest are finalising their bids with viewings set to take place in late February and March.
A final decision is not expected until the spring.
The government's Disposal Services Authority, which is handling the sale, wants to award at least one of the frigates to a UK ship recycler to determine the capacity of the UK's industry in the field.

He is also being investigated but denies any wrongdoing.
At the time of the move, Barcelona said they had paid 57m euros (£48.6m) for Neymar but it has been alleged that, if other contracts are taken into account, the actual cost of the player was far greater.
And last week a judge in Spain ruled there was sufficient evidence against Barcelona to continue investigations into the transfer.

If that sounds all too familiar and you fancy keeping the whole thing a bit more spiritual this year without giving up your gadgets, here are five ways to enjoy Christmas online:
Everyday Church Online, which launched in the UK in September, runs virtual services every Sunday for a net-based congregation from around the world. Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed.
So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.
""There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them,"" he says.
""The chat room is like the foyer of a church.""
Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:
Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.
""We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas,"" says Mr Parker.
""The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.""
The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website.
Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union.
The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.
""Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians,"" he says.
""The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.
""It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.""
You get the idea.
Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus.
There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits.
German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times.
There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable.
The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins.
Highlights include one ""Joseph Carpenter"" buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card.
The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.
""It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget,"" explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.
""The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.""
However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being ""too religious"".
After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language.
The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah.
It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.
""We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much,"" says founder Roald Lidal.
""One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan,"" adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.
""There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.""
As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.
""I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters,"" says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.
""The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.""
""Jesus would definitely be on Twitter,"" adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.

""He didn't stick out. He did his job. You can't say he was very sociable, we just told him what to do and he did it. He didn't speak much Swedish,"" he told news agency AFP.

The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details.
A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany.
""The matter is serious, it is clear,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper,
Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money.
However, one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily.
""This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee... He was not a top agent,""   the source said.
Germany is particularly sensitive to reports of espionage on its territory because many of its citizens from the formerly communist east of the country were spied upon by the Stasi secret police.",no

On Saturday he briefly attended a school prom held in his honour.
His mother Allison broke the news of his death on his Facebook page, saying: ""Devastated and heartbroken to say my beautiful boy's gone to Heaven.""
She added: ""God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.""
The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.
Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.
The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.
The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.
Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.
The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.
""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.
""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.""
At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.
The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months.
He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked.
Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school.
On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.
At the time, Jak wrote: ""This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have.
""I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.
""I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.""
In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.
After becoming ill Jak also visited the Kelpies, enjoyed a romantic meal with his girlfriend, went to a party in his honour which was attended by Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo, and spent time in a supercar and on a quad bike.

Australia detains any migrants trying to reach its shores by boat, and takes them to offshore processing camps to be eventually resettled elsewhere.
On Thursday, the New York Times described the policy as ""brutal"".
In an editorial, the newspaper said the ""ruthlessly effective"" policy was ""inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country's tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war"".
It said it would be ""unconscionable"" for European leaders to consider adopting similar policies, as Mr Abbott has previously suggested.
Australia has not responded to the editorial, but on Friday Mr Abbott said the image of Syrian three-year-old Alan Kurdi, who died trying to reach Greece by boat with his family, was ""very sad"".
""If you want to stop the deaths, if you want to stop the drownings you have got to stop the boats,"" he told ABC Radio.
""Thankfully, we have stopped that in Australia because we have stopped the illegal boats.""
On Thursday, Mr Abbott angered Australian Jewish groups by saying the so-called Islamic State (IS), from which many of the migrants to Europe are fleeing, was worse than the Nazis.
""The Nazis did terrible evil, but they had a sufficient sense of shame to try to hide it,"" he told Sydney Radio 2GB.
But IS militants, he said, ""boast about their evil, this is the extraordinary thing"".
The Executive Council of Australian Jewry Robert Goot said the comment was ""injudicious and unfortunate"", saying there was ""a fundamental difference between organised acts of terrorism and a genocide systematically implemented by a state as essential policy"".
""The crimes of Islamic State are indeed horrific but cannot be compared to the systematic round-up of millions of people and their despatch to purpose-built death camps for mass murder,"" he told Australian media.

He said he had already won backing from Poland that it would veto any move to strip Hungary of its EU voting rights.
The EU objects to Hungary's tight controls on asylum seekers and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as a higher education law.
Critics say the education law could lead to the closure of the prestigious Central European University, founded by philanthropist George Soros.
Thousands of Hungarians have held protest rallies against the laws in recent months.
Asked by Reuters on Monday whether Hungary would backtrack on any of the three issues, Mr Szijjarto answered: ""No. Why should we?
""These laws belong to national competence, so I think European institutions should refrain from making attempts at interfering with domestic issues.""
The minister added that ""my Polish colleague"" had made it very clear that Warsaw would veto any EU sanctions against Hungary.
EU rules envisage that such decisions as stripping a member country of its voting rights should be approved unanimously.
Hungary's right-wing Fidesz government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is under sustained pressure from European institutions to withdraw the three laws, two of which have already been passed, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports.
Hungary is currently forcibly housing asylum seekers in secured shipping containers, raising serious questions whether it is compatible with EU law.
Hungary's Higher Education Law, signed in April, could force the closure of the Budapest-based CEU, which ranks among the top 200 universities in the world in eight disciplines.
Meanwhile, draft legislation on NGOs is expected to go before parliament soon.
Human rights groups say it would stigmatise them as ""foreign-backed"" organisations.
Last month, the deputy head of the bloc's executive Commission, Frans Timmermans, warned action would be taken in coming weeks if there were no positive developments.

Government forces, backed by Russian allies, took nearly all remaining rebel-held parts of Aleppo this week.
It represents a major victory for President Bashar al-Assad.
He hailed the ""liberation"" of Aleppo and said history was being made.

How Srebrenica's survivors view Aleppo
What's happening in Aleppo?
What happens next?
The evacuation of civilians, rebels and their families had been due to take place on Wednesday but an earlier ceasefire deal collapsed.
""Some 3,000 civilians and more than 40 wounded, including children, were brought out,"" the head of the ICRC in Syria, Marianne Gasser, said after two convoys left.
""No-one knows how many people are left in the east, and the evacuation could take days,"" she added.
The evacuees are being transferred to rebel-held areas in neighbouring Idlib province.
US Secretary of State John Kerry meanwhile accused Syrian leaders of carrying out ""nothing short of a massacre"" in Aleppo and urged them to return to peace talks in Geneva.
""The only remaining question is whether the Syrian regime, with Russia's support, is willing to go to Geneva prepared to negotiate constructively, and whether or not they're willing to stop this slaughter of their own people,"" he said in Washington.
John Kerry expressed moral outrage at the fate of Aleppo and he stressed that the Syrian regime was responsible for the failure of a year's worth of US-Russian negotiations aimed at a nationwide ceasefire and peace talks.
But he didn't offer any new plan to end the conflict. Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. ""You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate,"" he told me.
Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.
Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - ""delusional diplomacy"", the Washington Post called it.
Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.
Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.
A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.
The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.
As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.
The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.
Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.
The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.
The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: ""A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.""
""This corridor is 21km long,"" he said, adding, ""6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.""
Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.
In a televised address, he said Turkey would take ""children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions"".
The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.
UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.
""If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo,"" he told reporters in Paris.
The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.
Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.
Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.
In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be ""the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists"", a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.
He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.

Stephen Paul Copoc was born on 1 August 1968, and was aged 20 years when he died at Hillsborough.
Stephen was the baby of our family, and the apple of our Mum's eye. Our family consisted of Mum and Dad, I, Peter, my sister Angela and then our Stephen. I was 10 years old when Stephen was born. Angela was just seven years old.
Our Dad took us to the hospital, so that we could meet our new baby brother. Mum and Dad said that Angela and I could name him, and we did. Financially, we had little, but our parents, Agnes and Harold, made sure that there was lots of love in our house.
Stephen was such a joy to all of us. Mum and Dad only received good reports from Stephen's school regarding his conduct and application to his lessons.
Profiles of all those who died
Stephen's personality was such that people warmed to him instantly as he had an easy way with him. He was popular with teachers and made friends, having the ability to also keep friends. The friends that he made when he was small were still his close friends when he died on that awful day.
When we moved from Garston to our new house in Speke, Stephen had no problems adapting to the new environment, getting to know our new neighbours and making friends in an effortless and  uncomplicated way.
I started work at 17. There was a shop in Garston called Smiths that sold everything. It's gone now. I bought Stephen a train set when I got paid. He was about nine at the time and wanted one.
As Angela and I were so much older than him, we kind of spoilt him, as he was such a lovable kid. I remember us both setting up the train set together and the joy Stephen got playing with it.
He was so careful about his toys. When he finished playing with the train set, he would put it away neatly. He minded his toys.
He used to follow Angela everywhere, even if she was going out to meet friends he would follow her and she would complain to Mum and Dad about having to bring 11 him.
However, one day someone told Angela that there was an accident on the road and that Stephen was hurt. Angela ran down the cinder path near our home towards the school crying.
When she got there, she was told he had not waited for the lollipop lady and got a bump from a car. He was physically fine, but Angela was sobbing and so distressed at the thought that Stephen was hurt.
Angela was so good to Stephen and minded him throughout his childhood. All her friends knew him well because he was like her shadow.
Stephen started to take an interest in birds when he was about 12 years old. He started to study them and could tell you the name of most birds as well as their  eggs. It was also around this time that he became interested in fishing.
We had cousins that were avid fishermen and they took him along to Speke Hall, which is a rural setting in a National Trust estate right in the middle of Liverpool. He just loved fishing there and knew all about the fish that lived in the waters there.
He seldom, if ever, brought fish home to Mum and Dad. It was a joke in our house about Stephen catching fish, but he preferred to put the fish back into the water.
We think it was the birds and the fishing that started Stephen wanted to work out of doors. He appreciated being outdoors.
He finished school at 16 years of age and studied for his City and Guilds in Botany and Horticulture. He could name any flower and plant and was perfectly at home with nature.
He applied for and got a job with the Liverpool Parks and Gardens based in Calderstones Park. He treasured his job and became a gardener at Sudley Hall in Mossley Hill.
He loved his work, the people he worked with, he enjoyed meeting all the visitors and telling them about the gardens.
When Stephen was about 15 years old, he met his girlfriend Jackie. They were very much in love and were engaged to be married when he died.
Stephen knew what he wanted from life. He was very close to our Mum and his main ambition in life was to save enough money to buy our parents a house. He did not want them living in rented accommodation.
He was mature and sensible for his age. He took out insurance policies in case anything happened to him, as he wanted our parents to have some money.
He was very caring to his nieces and nephews. When Angela's marriage broke down and she was on her own with her two children, Sean and Carla, Stephen with his  girlfriend Jackie would babysit and play with the children, keeping them amused for hours.
He could have been out with his mates but knew that Angela needed time alone and his family always came first with him.
Stephen, of course, loved football. His love of football and of Liverpool came from our Dad. The whole family travelled around to watch the matches, but not since 1989.
After 1989, we gave the season tickets back and we never went to a football match again.
Stephen loved to play football as well. He was not the best of players, but he was like an encyclopaedia when it came to anything about football generally.
Stephen was a great music fan. He was always playing Pink Floyd and, in particular, 'Shine on you Crazy Diamond'. He always loved Marillion and went to concerts with his four close friends.
Our parents never got over Stephen's death and the way he died. Our brother Stephen was one of life's genuine nice guys.
Our Stephen was just 20 years of age, but had maturity and a caring attitude towards others and even from a young age carried a donor card.
We miss Stephen from our family and think about what might have been for all of us as a family if Stephen had not died on that awful day. Thank you.",no

Potentially, though, the most controversial move will be putting politicians in charge of all but the most significant planning decisions.
Councils will be able to accept or reject developments in their own areas.
Currently, if you want to build a new house or erect an extension, you have to apply for permission to the Planning Service, an agency that comes under the umbrella of Stormont's environment department.
Planning officials refer your application to your local council. The councillors can express their opinion on the merits of your application, but the final say rests with the Planning Service.
From April 2015 that responsibility will shift to the councils themselves, meaning elected politicians will make planning decisions.
So is this a positive move, democratising our planning system?
Michael Corr, the creative director of Northern Ireland's architecture and planning centre, PLACE, is optimistic.
Mr Corr already works with councils and government departments, providing advice on new developments like leisure centres.

Speaking about voters, Mr Corr said: ""They really want to choose politicians who have the ability and understand urban regeneration and planning issues, because it's those politicians who will be able to make the biggest difference.""
However, not everyone is so upbeat.
Back in the 1960s, local councils in Northern Ireland were accused of discrimination in the allocation of public housing.
Protests, like the one against Dungannon council's allocation of housing in County Tyrone, fuelled the Civil Rights movement.
The environmental group Friends of the Earth warn that a strict code of conduct will have to be rigorously enforced in order to ensure the new councils' handling of planning matters is regarded as fair and transparent.
James Orr, Northern Ireland director for Friends of the Earth, said: ""In terms of property deals and in terms of politicking, we could see a situation not too far away from what happened in the 1960s, where certain communities get planning permission more favourably than other communities.""
Mr Orr is also concerned about what he describes as a ""tradition of close relationships between developers and political parties here"".
He said: ""It's quite easy to see that continuing, where we get a laissez-faire system which says, 'you look after your community and we won't bother engaging in proper democratic planning' . That is a real danger and that's why we need the nuts and bolts of good transparency put in place.""
Friends of the Earth argue that giving politicians more powers with real financial consequences for developers and objectors makes it increasingly important that the public should know who donates to Northern Ireland's political parties.
Some local politicians remain opposed to the move, because they say it could deter donors worried about their personal security.
Others argue that the Â£7,500 limit for declaring donations is largely irrelevant to Northern Ireland, as the Stormont parties don't attract such large amounts.
Under the terms of a law passed earlier this year, it's up to the Northern Ireland Secretary to decide when the time is right to make an order shedding more light on political donations.",no

But seamers Matt Taylor and Craig Miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the Welsh capital.
Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day.
Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the Brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against Northants at Swansea.
Aneurin Donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as Taylor and Miles prospered in the afternoon.
Graham Wagg and Timm van der Gugten scrambled Glamorgan to a consolation bonus point.
Gloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced.
Glamorgan are being led by Michael Hogan for the first time in the absence of Jacques Rudolph, who has a neck problem.
Glamorgan batsman Nick Selman told BBC Wales Sport:
""It was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so I got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after I got a hundred.

He told the BBC's Richard Hamilton about his experiences in the civil war, which ended in 2002, and his Ebola work:
I had a normal family life before the war started in 1991.
But at 15 I was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and taken to the jungle where I was trained on how to use a gun and initiated into the group.
I thought it was the end of my life. It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.
They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.
The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.
Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.
It seems like a nightmare now.
I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.
If they said: ""We don't have food"", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.
Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.
I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.
Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.
I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.
Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.
He encouraged me saying: ""You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.""
At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.
Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.
He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.
When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.
We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.
Through this so many lives were saved.
There were three key activities.
We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.
We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.
Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.
Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.
People were frightened.
Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.
It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.
One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.
There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.
When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.
We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.
Now I see my life as a changed person.
I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.
We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.
If we invest in them then we are building the future.

The win means Egypt play Ghana on Wednesday with top spot of Group D still at stake, while Uganda are out of their first tournament since 1978.
Ghana secured their place in the quarter-finals with a 1-0 victory over Mali earlier on Saturday.
On a deteriorating pitch in Port-Gentil, seven-times champions Egypt failed to break down a resolute Cranes defence for long periods.
Onyango made an impressive clearing header to deny the onrushing Salah at the end of an otherwise lifeless first half.
Uganda began the second half brightly, forcing veteran Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary to punch several set-pieces clear but ultimately failed to register a shot on target as Ochaya turned in Faruku Miya's through ball from a clearly offside position on 52 minutes.
El Said blasted a shot well over when unmarked and Marwan Mohsen went close for the Pharaohs with a header, but Egypt appeared to be heading for their second consecutive goalless draw.
However, an otherwise quiet Salah showed great composure late on to check his shot and play in El Said with a reverse pass, the substitute's close-range shot evading Onyango.
Uganda now face Mali in the final round of group games on Wednesday, with Mali needing a win and for Ghana to beat Egypt by two goals or more if they are to qualify.

""This decision is abhorrent and I shall be fighting it every step of the way,"" he said.
""The government has a great deal of questions to answer over why it is proposing to close a well-loved and historic barracks in a vitally important military town.
""Brecon Barracks has served our country with distinction over its long history, with soldiers from the site fighting in every conflict since the early 19th century.

""We're trying to do everything to educate these young people for peace, introducing ideas of tolerance and co-existence,"" Mr Thneibat, who is also Jordan's education minister, told the international conference in Dubai.
But he warned that Syria's neighbours did not have the capacity to deal with such an influx of families without more international assistance.
He said Jordan was training thousands more teachers and building new schools, which would operate in double shifts to try to accommodate 145,000 refugee children in its state school system.
But there were still more children arriving than could be taught, he warned.
There had been financial support from the international community - and more had been pledged, Mr Thneibat said - but almost two-thirds of the cost of each extra refugee pupil was being taken from Jordan's own education budget, he said.
This was in addition to extra costs in health, housing and infrastructure.
Without any access to education, he said such youngsters could become part of another cycle of conflict.

But transition spokesman Jason Miller's insistence that the Trumps were ""energised and excited about their new role serving the country"" and it was simply concern about changing schools in the middle of the year did little to quell criticisms on social media.
""First Family resides in White House as a symbol of our country to us and and the world,"" wrote one Twitter user, Pamela Benbow. ""Melania Trump's decision is appalling.""
Others joked it was Mrs Trump's taste in interiors which had prompted the decision, while some began speculating about what the move said about the Trumps' marriage.
However, the strength of feeling is somewhat unsurprising. There are only two other First Ladies in the history of the United States who have not made the White House their home during their husbands' years as commander-in-chief: Martha Washington, because it had yet to be built, and Anna Harrison, because her husband died before she could take up residence.
But Mrs Trump's decision has its supporters.
""Good, this is what most responsible parents do with a child Barron's age,"" one Twitter user noted.
However, it is not out of character for Mrs Trump, who has repeatedly stressed that Barron, 10, is her focus - staying at home during the campaign to care for him in Trump Towers.
But they are far from the only mother and child to move into the White House. So how have families coped before?
William Seale, a White House Historical Association historian and author of The President's House, said President Grover Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom Cleveland, only lived in the White House during social season.
The president bought a house during his first term, where Mrs Cleveland spent most of her time. The first lady referred to the first home as ""Oak View"" but it was more commonly known as ""Red Top"" because of its red roof.
But the young bride, who was age 21 when she married the 49-year-old president, was the only first lady to be married in the White House.
""The concern of children staying back to finish school - that's more typical than not,"" Mr Seale said.
""It seems not very unusual to me that she would want the child to finish this year of school. I don't find it very surprising.""
Mr Seale noted that the children of President John Tyler, who became president after William Henry Harrison's death, were not immediately moved to the White House.
James Madison's wife, Dolley Madison, also sent her son from her first marriage, Payne Todd, away to school.
There have been two sets of school age children living in the White House in the past three decades: Chelsea Clinton, who was 12 at the time, and Malia and Sasha Obama, who were 10 and seven respectively.
They also had to move across the country when their fathers became president - but all three lived at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue from the day of the inauguration.
In fact, the Obamas avoided the problem of the girls having to change school mid-term by moving to Washington early, allowing them to start a new school a few weeks before Dad was inaugurated in January 2009.

Mrs Trump has indicated Barron will be her top priority, with everything else coming second. Reading between the lines, it suggests she will not be taking on the full-time role predecessors like Mrs Obama have.
Officially, the role of the first lady is only ceremonial - she is supposed to be the White House's hostess, organising and attending functions with or without their spouses.
In more recent times, they have also sought out causes to support and promote. Mrs Obama has used her time backing a number of initiatives and projects, including Let Girls Learn, that aims to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school.
The first lady occupies a very public role, according to Mr Seale.
""It gives a kind of personal side to the White House. It might even be considered vital to the public's perception of the president,"" he said. ""[The president] is an administrator and a he is a symbol and I think the first lady's role is very important to that symbol part.""
Lou Henry Hoover, wife to President Herbert Hoover, was the first president's wife to really take on an active public role, Mr Seale said.
Her immediate successor, Eleanor Roosevelt, also served as a more visible first lady in her husband's administration.
One notable first lady who was reluctant to step into the public role was Nancy Reagan, according to Mr Seale.
Mrs Reagan, who had a big influence on her husband's presidency and would later become known for her anti-drug campaign, was at first only focused on being a supportive wife.
""Her big interest in the world was her husband,"" Mr Seale said, adding that she was a very private person.
As to what Melania's priorities will be there is only one hint - she is interested in tackling cyber-bullying.

It has happened in the past. However, not when the president's wife has still been alive.
Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph took the role in 1801, while Angelica van Buren took up the duties of a first lady after marrying President Martin van Buren's son in 1838. Both men had lost their wives almost 20 years earlier.
However, could Ivanka Trump - described as her father's ""proxy wife"" by Vanity Fair during the election campaign - take up some of the responsibility from her step-mother?
There is more recent precedent, too. Chelsea performed some of her mother's duties during the final days of her father's presidency, while Mrs Clinton concentrated on her own political career.
The White House can be whatever the family makes it.
Chelsea was known to do her homework in the Oval Office from time to time, while she also hosted sleepovers for friends - which could mean they found themselves sitting with the President the next morning, as Bill Clinton always tried to have breakfast with his daughter.
Both Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama fit their duties as First Lady around their children, and both families asked for the press to respect their daughters' privacy - requests which were, on the whole, respected.
The Obamas are also strict about putting time aside for the girls: family dinner takes place every night at 18:30. Mr Obama has said only a national emergency will stop him joining his family.
""The surprising truth is that being in the White House has made our family life more 'normal' than it's ever been,"" the President said in an interview with US magazine More earlier this year.
It is a response echoed by Chelsea about her own years.
She told the Huffington Post: ""I was always deeply aware that I was living in history. But then I would have dinner with my parents at the kitchen table every night. There was so much about my life that also was normal.""",no

The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week.
Westwood's partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem, and his place went to Chris Wood.
Under tournament rules, Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan.
""I'm disappointed not to be playing,"" said Westwood.
""I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything.""
The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit.
Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament.
Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai.
Noren, another Swede, needs to finish at least second and hope Stenson and Willett finish down the field.
McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field.
It took McIlroy 14 holes to register his first birdie of the day, and although he swiftly added another on the next, the four-time major winner double-bogeyed the 16th after needing two attempts - the second minus his right shoe and sock - to play from the edge of a water hazard.

She added: ""God bless. Jak I am the proudest Mummy ever xxxxx Simply the best xxx.""
The West Calder High School pupil had been documenting his life and treatment on social media.
Since he was diagnosed with cancer last August, Jak had been posting updates on a Facebook page called Jak's Journey with the help of his mother, sister Aimie and girlfriend Hannah Boyd.
The teenager's story of his fight against cancer, and his relentlessly positive attitude, touched the hearts of many people in West Lothian and beyond.
The Jak's Journey page attracted more than 28,000 Likes and documented the teenage goalkeeper's love of Rangers FC, and his meetings with former Ibrox stars Neil Alexander and Nacho Novo and current goalkeeper Cammy Bell.
On Saturday, he managed to make it along to his prom for 10 minutes but had to leave as he felt unwell.
Jak was greeted at the event by former Rangers captain Barry Ferguson.
The teenager wrote on his page: ""I would just like to make a massive apology for me only turning up and then having to go again.
""I was gutted and really sad as I never spoke to anyone, but I took really unwell really quickly as I had been lying in bed for three days without hardly moving.
""Thank you to everyone who organised it and came along. Even just knowing it was all happening for me makes me smile.""
At the party, Jak's family collected the teenager's Bronze Duke of Edinburgh Award and also the Kerry MacGregor Memorial Trophy for overcoming adversity.
The Jak's Journey website highlighted Jak's stay at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow over the past few months.
He was visited by players from Celtic, Hibs, Hearts and Edinburgh Rugby and the cast of the musical Wicked.
Jak and his family also published many other personal moments, including him playing his tuba and visiting his classmates and teachers at school.
On 23 January, Jak and his family found out from doctors that his cancer had spread throughout his body. The medics made a decision to not pursue any other treatment.
At the time, Jak wrote: ""This is the saddest day of our lives yet but I am going to fight the pain and get as many days/weeks/months/years I can get. They can't give me a timescale to how long I have.
""I am so sorry to give everyone this horrible news but there's no other way to put it.
""I would like to thank all the doctors, nurses and everyone who has helped me over the past six months, they have tried their best for me.""
In the days after he received the news, Jak's family urged people to donate to a fundraising page for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research.

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.
The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live.
The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers.
They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18.
Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts.
And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending.
This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said.
They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime.
The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts.
Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said.
This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account.
The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal.
The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles.
It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government.
Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.
""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.""
Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.
A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.
Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.
A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.
Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.
""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.""
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.

The church's senior pastor, Gary Beattie, said he was amazed by how many people have supported Josh and his family so far.
""We were in total shock when he was diagnosed, and really the family just wanted support from people and to ask people to pray for Josh,"" Gary said.

This, despite the passage of a couple of generations in sheep-years, says Kevin Sinclair, professor of developmental biology at Nottingham and lead author on the study, makes them Dolly's - and that original ewe's - identical twin sisters.

We're standing in a straw-lined pen in a barn on the university's Sutton Bonington Campus and one-by-one all 13 sheep are put through the same set of exacting, methodical tests.
As far as I can tell it's a process the sheep seem well used to. If not exactly enthusiastic, they stoically endure the joint manipulations with something approaching world weary resignation.
But if the sheep seem unfazed by all the attention, that may be because they are among the most closely monitored and studied animals anywhere in the world.
According to Prof Sinclair, the fate of the whole science of cloning may hang on the results.
He tells me: ""One of the big questions that surrounded the creation of Dolly, and all the cloning work that has gone on since, is: do these animals age in a normal way and how healthy are they?""
Underpinning this question is a fundamental concern about the cloning process. Because it involves extracting DNA from the cell of an adult animal - a cell that is fully differentiated and has been through multiple cell divisions - some ""age-memory"" might be transferred into the next generation.
""That would mean that the cloned animal was somehow much older that you might expect,"" says Prof Sinclair.
""A new born clone might look like a lamb, but in terms of cellular senescence it would be much older, and the animal would start to develop diseases associated with aging at a much younger age.""
The original Dolly died at the relatively modest age for a sheep of six-and-a-half. Along with several other members of her flock she had contracted a virus that caused lesions to develop in her lungs and she had to be put down.
But by then Dolly was already suffering from osteoarthritis which, although not unheard of in a sheep of her age, did raise concerns about premature aging. The decision was taken to go back to the original cell line and to produce more clones.
""We wanted to know if Dolly's untimely death was just unlucky"", recalled Prof Sinclair, ""or if it was something to do with the cloning process itself. If illnesses like arthritis that are associated with old age were more common in cloned animals.""
Getting the answers to those questions has involved putting the dollies, and nine other sheep cloned from different cell lines, through an exhaustive battery of tests and assessments including regular joint X-rays and a series of full-body fMRI scans.
Prof Sinclair said: ""We focused on three co-morbidities: cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoarthritis - the three co-morbidities most associated with aging. Were these animals any different from the wider population of sheep with regard to these particular co-morbidities.""
The results of the study, which could have profound implications for the future of cloning, will be published next week. But for now, the dollies, which are approaching their ninth and tenth birthdays, seem to be in rude health.

But the Uruguay striker, 27, can now train and play in friendly matches, with new club Barcelona confirming: ""He will join the first team's training session, scheduled for Friday.
""The public presentation of Suarez as a new Barcelona player will be held on Monday at the Camp Nou.""
It is not known if he will play in Monday's game with Mexico's Club Leon.
A full explanation of the Cas ruling, which still prevents him from playing ""organised"" matches but now allows him to take part in all ""football-related activities"", will be published at a later date.
He will still have to serve the remaining eight games of his record nine-match ban in competitive international games, while his competitive Barcelona debut is likely to be at Real Madrid on 26 October in El Clasico.
But Suarez will now be available for Uruguay's friendlies against Japan and South Korea in September and Saudi Arabia the following month.
Suarez's lawyers argued that world governing body Fifa's decision to suspend him from all football-related activity for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 2014 World Cup group match in Brazil in June was too strong a punishment.
Switzerland-based Cas - an independent body whose rulings are accepted by most sporting organisations - said: ""The sanctions imposed on the player by Fifa have been generally confirmed.""
But it said preventing Suarez from taking part in any football activity was ""excessive"", as not allowing him to train would have an impact on the player after the suspension had ended.
World players' union Fifpro said it was ""disappointed that the court had decided not to strongly diminish the sanctions"" and ""remain of the view they are disproportionate in relation to his violation of the Fifa disciplinary code"".
It added: ""We regret Cas not deciding to reduce the length of Suarez's bans in exchange for an obligation for him to receive treatment.""
In addition to being allowed to train and play in friendlies, the former Liverpool player - who moved to Barcelona last month for £75m - can also attend matches and take part in promotional activities.
His legal team said the appeal was a success, arguing Fifa had ""misapplied its own rules when considering the case and the sanction it imposed was disproportionate"".
Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker tweeted: ""Luis Suarez's appeal against a four-month ban has failed. He is though, sensibly I think, now allowed to train with the team.""
""By allowing Suarez to train, Cas appears to have taken into account the club's interests and has emphasised any appropriate sanction for such incidents should be proportionate,"" said Hannah Clipston, a lawyer specialising in resolving disputes.
""What is proportionate for a repeat offender is different to what is proportionate for a first time offender.""
Suarez apologised nearly a week after the incident, despite initially claiming to have lost his balance.
He was previously suspended for biting PSV Eindhoven midfielder Otman Bakkal and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.
In 2011, he was also given an eight-match suspension and fined £40,000 for racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra.",no

Although his family achieved success in opal trading, their greatest discovery has been seen rarely by the public.
That has just changed.
The 998g (35.2oz) opal, valued at nearly A$900,000 (Â£550,000; $680,000), is now on display in Adelaide's South Australian Museum.
Still largely in its original condition, the opal's two polished faces reveal a kaleidoscope of colours from green to yellow to red.
""When my father was alive, it was originally kept separately from all trading because it was such a significant piece,"" Alan Bartram told the BBC.
""We decided we would retain that intention, and keep it as a significant and obviously excellent example of light opal from South Australia.""
The family has decided to pass it on for future generations to enjoy.
The museum's director, Brian Oldman, said the opal's rarity should not be underestimated.
""Opal of this quality can only be created under certain climate conditions,"" Mr Oldman said.
""When our state's inland sea evaporated millions of years ago, it provided a unique silica-rich environment for the creation of precious opal. It is these exceptional conditions that created the Fire of Australia.""
A mining town for more than 100 years, Coober Pedy still draws people lured by the hope of striking it rich.
""They're becoming more scarce because the overheads of mining now are getting to be so expensive - in fuel, explosives, machinery and living costs on the field,"" Mr Bartram said.

Five competitions between them, five golds won. As of Tuesday night, had the couple been a country they would have sat 13th on the medal table, above Jamaica, Kenya and Brazil.
That would be to misunderstand what makes them tick. This is a couple who got engaged while on the sofa watching an episode of EastEnders.
You might think too that it would get competitive around the breakfast table in the cottage they share just outside Knutsford in Cheshire. Kenny now has six Olympic golds from three Games, more than Sir Steve Redgrave and Sir Bradley Wiggins. Trott has four, more than any other British woman, and from one fewer Olympics.
That would be to misjudge their relationship. Cycling superstars on their own, together they can be almost ordinary, almost invisible. After the gold rush, after their tearful embrace in the Rio velodrome with the world watching on, that may be about to change.
""The difference in their characters is what makes it work for them,"" says Trott's father Adrian.
""Until he gets to know you, Jason is a little bit shy. He's quiet and understated. Laura is bubbly, chatty, just as you see in her interviews.
""If they were both like Jason, God only knows how they'd talk about anything. And God forbid having two Lauras in a household!""
The relationship between the two began in the build-up to London 2012, with Kenny about to come out of Chris Hoy's muscled shadow at his second Olympics and Trott about to experience her first.
""I remember seeing Laura at the velodrome years ago,"" says Kenny's mother Lorraine.
""I said to my husband, 'Flipping heck, you need to watch this young lady.' She was in the elimination race, only a tiny thing, and she kept sprinting over the top of everyone. She was amazing.
""The first time I knew something was happening between the two of them was when Jason phoned me up and said, 'I'm bringing Trotty home for a bacon butty.'
""I said to him, 'Is she your girlfriend?' 'No, she's just a friend.'
""She made herself at home straight away. Into the house, sat down, feet up on the sofa.
""We liked her from the off. She's a girly girl, so I can talk make-up and clothes to her. It's such a treat - having had two sons, I've had years of remote-control cars and standing out in the rain, and at last I can talk to someone about posh shoes.""
Trott and Kenny are not the first couple to both win Olympic golds.
Some (Steffi Graf, ladies' singles 1988, Andre Agassi, men's singles 1996) have carried more global renown. Others have also won gold in the same sport at the same Games, most recently triathletes Jan Frodeno and Emma Snowsill at Beijing in 2008. But no-one at a summer Games has more. No-one else gets even close.
Neither has the British duo finished. Trott is 24, Kenny 28. The next Olympics in Tokyo are in their sights.
""When I first met Laura, what stuck in my mind was how she was on what she wanted to achieve,"" says her agent Luke Lloyd Davies.
""She said to me, 'I want to be the most decorated British Olympian of all time'. I remember thinking, for a 21-year-old to have that determination is remarkable.
""She reminds me of [former England rugby union player] Jonny Wilkinson - that same dedication, the way nothing will faze her in competition. Off the bike she is a really sweet 20-something. She likes getting dressed up, she dreams of Mulberry bags and Prada shoes. But when her peers are out partying, she is burying herself in training.""
And there is nothing glamorous about the sessions each put in at the velodrome at Manchester's Sportcity each day. Lap after 250m lap, staring at the black line and scuffed boards, round and round, lactic in the legs, fire in the lungs.
""It hurts so badly,"" Trott once told me. ""It's like your legs are getting squeezed. You try to fight against it, but it's horrible, and they're just getting tighter and tighter. You're going slower and slower.""
Nothing has come easy. Born six weeks premature with a collapsed lung, Trott spent the first weeks of her life in intensive care. As a child she suffered serious asthma; at the exact moment she first sat on a bike, aged four, her big sister Emma - who would go on to race professionally for the Dutch team Dolmans-Boels - was crashing and breaking her leg at the bottom of the same hill.
As a young girl she preferred trampolining to her bike, only to be forced to give it up after repeatedly passing out in mid-air. ""I kept getting dehydrated during sessions, because you had to go out of the room to get a drink, and I was like, 'Nah, I'll carry on bouncing'.""
That's the heroic stuff. Not everything she does ends in such glorious success,
""Laura is the sort of person who can ruin a baked potato in a microwave,"" says Adrian.
""We've always cooked with gas at home, but when she first moved into the British Cycling academy flats in Manchester, they had electricity instead. She put a potato in the oven to bake and thought she'd turned the gas on - except she'd put the grill on instead. Pretty soon it was on fire. She smoked the whole flat out.""
So it is that Kenny tends to be entrusted with kitchen duties.
""He is a very good cook,"" says Lorraine. ""He now does a brilliant Sunday roast, although he never used to cook when he lived at home. He says Laura is the bad influence, that she's the one who buys the chocolate.
""He gets his sporting genes from me. I used to run 100m and 200m. His dad Michael is very self-disciplined, and Jason has inherited that from him.
""Unlike me, he copes well under pressure. I have to force myself to watch him in big finals. I used to put my hands over my eyes, but then he lost a race when I was doing that so I've had to go back to actually looking.
""When they were younger, we took both our boys to different sports - they were lively lads, so we were trying to keep them out of mischief. We were just an ordinary family, and he was an ordinary boy doing ordinary things.
""He's not changed at all. He's just Jason. His elder brother Craig is the chatterbox, so maybe Jason thought he never needed to talk. But he has a fantastic sense of humour. It's so dry I think sometimes people don't get it.""
Find out how to get into cycling with our special guide.
When they return to the UK, Trott and Kenny will wind down by walking their two dogs, springer-poodle crosses named Pringle and Sprolo. In September they will get married. Already they have turned down an offer to have it featured in a magazine.
Fame has never been the driving force. Kenny may have 54,000 followers on Twitter, but he last tweeted in early July. Trott may have won more Olympic gold medals than any other British woman, but the motivation remains pure.
""It isn't a job to me, but if it did feel like one, it would be a dream job,"" she says. ""All I do is ride my bike for four hours a day and then lie on the sofa for the rest of it. I don't feel like I'd ever fall out of love with it.""
And each understands exactly what the other is going through. How could they not, when together they have turned a cottage in Cheshire into a medal factory?
""If I was in a relationship with someone outside cycling,"" says Trott, ""just imagine how hard it would be. I'd have to explain everything from scratch.""

The issue has been rumbling in recent years amid an increasingly assertive stance from China over its claims.
Last week, several collisions were reported between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in disputed waters as the Vietnamese ships sought to prevent the installation of the Chinese drilling rig.
Reports suggest the stand-off - involving dozens of ships - is continuing, with water cannon fire being exchanged.
On Sunday, anti-China protests took place in several Vietnamese cities. It is the most serious confrontation between the two nations for several years.
In Monday's telephone call, Mr Kerry ""said China's introduction of an oil rig and numerous government vessels in waters disputed with Vietnam was provocative"", US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.

A Nuffield Trust review found examples of nurses filling in for hospital doctors and pharmacists for GPs.
But unions warned against using it as a quick fix for problems in the NHS.
It has been well documented that there are gaps in junior doctor rotas, while GPs are struggling to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors.
NHS Employers asked the Nuffield Trust to look at ways the 1.3 million-strong workforce could be reshaped to help.
The think tank highlighted examples of areas that were already experimenting.
These included:
The report said as well as helping cover for doctor shortages, such moves made sense because of the changing nature of care, with much more stress on looking after people with long-term conditions such as diabetes and heart disease rather than curing them.
It said that as doctors only made up about one in 10 of the workforce much more was needed from other health staff, but the Nuffield Trust admitted money would need to be set aside to ensure it happened.

NHS short of front-line staff, MPs say
Report author Candace Imison said there were ""huge opportunities"" in reshaping the workforce, in both improving patient care and providing staff with more rewarding roles.
And NHS Employers chief executive Danny Mortimer said: ""Our challenge now is to take forward the learning and recommendations in the report.""
But British Medical Association leader Dr Mark Porter said while he supported increasing the skills of the workforce, this should not be done ""at the expense of good quality training for doctors or indeed doctors themselves"".
""It takes doctors many years to learn how to provide the best care for their patients, and there is no substitute for this kind of expertise and experience,"" he said.
""There should be more staff support for doctors to help them coordinate the best possible care for their patients.""
And Unison head of health Christina McAnea said the squeeze on funding in the health service meant there was ""all too often"" no funding for training courses.
""Developing the NHS support workforce must not be seen as a quick and cheap fix for the chronic shortages of nurses and other health workers across the country,"" she added.

0.4,0.0,1.0,['the university of cambridge'],[],30216408,BERTS2S,"the number of children using tablet computers in schools is rising, according to research from the university of cambridge.","But the study says there is no clear evidence of academic improvement for pupils using tablet devices.
The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.
Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.
The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.
Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.
But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.
The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.
The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.
Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.
But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.
Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.
But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.
And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.
Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.
""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said.
A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.
It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.
The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.
Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"".
About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.
Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.
It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.
Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.
Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.
Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"".
The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"".
Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.
The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.
""I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is,"" said Mr Mason.",no

The committee formally recommended the scheme to parliament after members voted four to two in favour of it.
Members also rejected an amendment from Green MSP Andy Wightman noting ""concerns"" about wider local tax plans.
The proposals would see the average band E household pay about £2 per week more, and the average household in the highest band (H) about £10 a week more.
Parliament has to pass an order, a piece of secondary legislation, to change the bands, and Mr Mackay has now won the formal backing of the committee for that. Members will submit a report to parliament, before the order is voted on by all MSPs at a later date.
Putting forward a motion to have the committee recommend the move to parliament, Mr Mackay told its members that his plans would lead to a ""more progressive"" and ""fairer"" system of local taxation.
Mr Wightman lodged an amendment to the finance secretary's motion to ""note concerns"" about the fact the council tax base has not been updated since 1991 and recognising the recommendation of the Commission on Local Tax Reform that ""the present council tax system must end"".
Labour's Elaine Smith backed Mr Wightman, saying the committee should ""reflect the evidence"" heard from members.
But SNP and Conservative members united against the amendment, with Tory Graham Simpson saying there ""isn't much point"" to adding it to the debate.
Mr Simpson also opposed Mr Mackay's original motion, saying it represented a ""fundamental change"" to the way local services are funded, and undermined local accountability.
The motion ultimately passed by four votes to two, with Ms Smith joining the three SNP members and Mr Wightman abstaining.
The committee will now compile a report on the issue for parliament, while it will be down to the parliamentary bureau to decide if there needs to be a further chamber debate on the issue as well as a vote.
The government was only saved from a chamber defeat over council tax in September when Labour leader Kezia Dugdale's vote failed to register.
Opposition members had successfully amended a government motion promoting its council tax reform strategy, changing the wording to condemn the approach as undermining local accountability. But the final vote on the amended motion was tied after Ms Dugdale's vote was not counted.
Mr Wightman had also called for a revaluation of council tax bands during the committee debate, pointing out that the current bands were based on property values dating back to 1991.
The Green MSP said he had a constituent whose flat was in band E, but was worth £20,000 less than neighbouring flats in band B.
Labour's Elaine Smith pointed out that some council tax payers weren't even born when the council tax values of their properties were determined.
Mr Mackay said a ""costly"" revaluation would ""take time"" and could be a ""shock"" to many households - with some potentially facing ""astronomically high"" tax increases under a full revaluation.
But he said the changes to bands were ""not the end of the story in terms of local tax [reform]"", saying the government was taking a ""balanced approach"" while seeking to ""make council tax more progressive"".
The Scottish government has started the process of reforming local taxation following on from the Commission on Local Tax Reform, which called for a fairer, more transparent and progressive tax to fund local services.
Opposition members have accused the government of ""tinkering"" with the system rather than making bold reforms.
The Scottish Conservatives support an end to the council tax freeze and increases to the top two bands, but oppose the changes to bands E and F.
But Labour and the Greens both want to see the ""hated"" council tax scrapped, with Labour repeatedly accusing the SNP of abandoning an earlier promise to do so.",no

Benteke becomes the Reds' second most expensive signing, on what the club describe as a ""long-term contract"".
Liverpool, who last week sold forward Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for £49m, triggered a release clause in Benteke's contract to make the 24-year-old their seventh summer signing.
Belgium international Benteke scored 49 goals in 101 games for Villa after signing from Genk for £7m in 2012.
He told the Liverpool website: ""I'm very happy to be here. I came here to win trophies. I came here to reach some great goals with the team.
""It was the right club for me because I had a good chat with the manager and I wanted to be part of his project.""
Liverpool struggled for goals last season following the £75m sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and prolonged injury absences for England international Daniel Sturridge as they finished sixth in the Premier League.
Signings Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert produced three league goals and, after acknowledging the lack of scoring last season, manager Brendan Rodgers has added Benteke to revive the Reds' attack.
Liverpool have also signed forwards Danny Ings from Burnley and Brazil international Roberto Firmino from Hoffenheim, while Benteke's international team-mate Divock Origi has returned to the club after spending last season on loan at Lille.
Benteke missed the 2014 World Cup in Brazil with an Achilles tendon injury but returned to action last October and scored 15 times to help Villa stay in the Premier League and reach the FA Cup final.
Former Villa manager Paul Lambert, who brought Benteke into English football, believes he will do well at Anfield.
Lambert told BBC Sport: ""He's a brilliant number nine. He won't need just crosses to come into the box. If he gets the service he'll get goals.
""That's the type of guy he is and on his game he's a handful. I'm delighted for him. He's earned that move and if he can do what I think he can do, he'll do great for them.
""He's going to have to handle the expectancy level of winning [at Liverpool]. When you speak to Christian, he has a great belief in himself to do well.""

He told the BBC's Richard Hamilton about his experiences in the civil war, which ended in 2002, and his Ebola work:
I had a normal family life before the war started in 1991.
But at 15 I was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and taken to the jungle where I was trained on how to use a gun and initiated into the group.
I thought it was the end of my life. It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.
They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.
The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.
Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.
It seems like a nightmare now.
I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.
If they said: ""We don't have food"", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.
Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.
I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.
Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.
I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.
Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.
He encouraged me saying: ""You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.""
At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.
Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.
He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.
When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.
We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.
Through this so many lives were saved.
There were three key activities.
We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.
We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.
Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.
Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.
People were frightened.
Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.
It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.
One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.
There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.
When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.
We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.
Now I see my life as a changed person.
I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.
We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.
If we invest in them then we are building the future.

Living in poverty also increased the likelihood of violence among both boys and girls.
The government has said Scotland is becoming a safer place to live.
The study was carried out by University of Edinburgh researchers.
They found that a history of being in trouble with the police was the strongest predictor of whether a young person was not in education, employment or training by the age of 18.
Poorer young people were also about five times more likely to be placed on statutory supervision than their better-off counterparts.
And household poverty was identified as an exacerbating factor that increased the likelihood of young people offending.
This was the case even when a range of other risk factors have been taken into account, the researchers said.
They found that people who lived in extreme poverty were much more likely to be the victims - and perpetrators - of crime.
The study also identified gender as one of the most powerful predictors of violence, with boys being three times more likely than girls on average to engage in violent acts.
Girls from poorer backgrounds were twice as likely as girls from more affluent households to be involved in violent crime, the authors said.
This was the case even after other factors - such as truancy, substance abuse and poor parental supervision - were taken into account.
The findings from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, by the University of Edinburgh's School of Law, has been published in the latest edition of the Scottish Justice Matters journal.
The study has tracked 4,300 young people in Edinburgh since 1998 to better understand changes in their behaviour and lifestyles.
It has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Nuffield Foundation and the Scottish government.
Report author Prof Lesley McAra said: ""Our findings highlight a very destructive dynamic - poverty increases the risks of violence. Contact with juvenile justice system increases the risks associated with poverty.
""As a result, contact with the very agencies meant to stop offending is inadvertently reproducing the conditions in which violence can flourish.""
Scottish Justice Matters also published a report that showed the recent fall in crime rates in Scotland has not benefitted areas with the most chronic rates of crime.
A study by Applied Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Research Centre - also based at the University of Edinburgh's Law School - suggested that victims experiencing the most crime continued to be within the most deprived communities.
Half of the communities with the highest crime rates were found in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of chronic health problems, the report showed.
A third of the communities with the highest rates of crime were in the top 20% of areas with the highest levels of unemployment.
Lead researcher Prof Susan McVie said: ""The findings are important as they suggest that crime tends to be highly concentrated amongst poor people and within poor neighbourhoods, and this has not changed despite crime being at its lowest level for decades.
""This raises important questions about whether inequality is being adequately tackled by the Scottish government.""
A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Scotland is becoming a safer place to live with recorded crime at a 41-year low, homicide figures at their lowest level in 39 years and 1,000 extra officers on our streets.
""The Scottish government has a long-standing record on protecting the poorest and most vulnerable in our society and we are tackling poverty and inequalities head-on through a number of initiatives including a Â£296m investment to limit the damaging effects of the UK government's welfare cuts.""",yes

The visitors led briefly through Vasil Lobzhanidze's early try, but the Scots raced ahead through Tommy Seymour, a penalty try, Sean Maitland and Stuart Hogg before the break.
Hamish Watson extended the lead, battling over soon after half-time.
Lobzhanidze bagged a second from a huge Georgian scrum, before Hogg finished off a searing counter-attack.
Before the Scottish points deluge, it was the Georgians who opened the scoring. It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.
The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.
The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.
Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.

Georgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.
The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.
The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.
Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.
Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.
Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: ""It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.
""In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.
""But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.
""I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him. And we just keep improving.""

But the jury cleared Vallely's friend Aaeron Evans of manslaughter after Cardiff Crown Court was told he was not present during the attack.
Vallely, 24, will be sentenced on 8 December.
The unconscious body of Pte Boyd, who served with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, was found by police in the town in the early hours of 8 May.
Pte Boyd, who is originally from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, had been in the town for training exercises at the infantry battle school.
During the trial, the court heard Pte Boyd was making his way back to the barracks when he was attacked outside a bar called The Cellar.
CCTV footage showed the soldier being punched, going to the ground and being beaten until he no longer moved.
Vallely then dragged his body from the scene before fleeing.
The trial was told the killer had been on a seven hour drinking binge and in the hour before the attack was boasting he was the ""hardest man in Brecon"".
His friend Mr Evans was cleared of any involvement in the attack, after the jury was told he had left the scene before the start of any violence.
Senior investigating officer Det Supt David Guiney, from Dyfed-Powys Police, called the attack ""a despicable act"" that ""shocked"" the community of Brecon.
""I plead with anyone who plans a night out drinking with their friends to please, walk away from any conflict, do not resort to violence,"" he said.
A family tribute described Pte Boyd as an ""all-rounder"" who had ""a promising career ahead of him which has been cut short"".
The tribute read: ""Matthew was full of life. He was loving, caring and loyal. He was always playing jokes on his peers and family, and always brought smiles to our faces.""
It said Vallely had created ""a void in our family that will never be filled"", adding the ""unbearable pain"" was something they will have to live with for the rest of their lives.
""During this trial, it has been mentioned that Jake Vallely called himself the 'hardest man in Brecon' on the night that he murdered Matthew,"" the tribute said.
""He couldn't have been more wrong. There has been such a massive outpouring of love from the community in Brecon towards our family; in our mind, those are the strongest people in Brecon.""",no

He was one of the most public British fighters in Syria - always online, but always masked.
But now, Imran Khawaja, 27, from Southall, west London is facing a possible prison term up to life imprisonment for his role in life and death on Syria's battlefields.
Khawaja left the UK last January. He called himself Abu Daigham al-Britani. And after reaching the warzone via Kurdish territory, he began posting videos and pictures of his personal jihad.
In one video he explains how a fellow fighter was shot through the side - but ""thanks to Allah's will"" was soon back on the front line. In another - masked again - he is showing off his amateur weight-lifting skills as his brothers-in-arms cheer him on.
Khawaja was a member of Rayat al Tawheed - which means Flag of Unity. The group of fighters affiliated to Islamic State includes many British men, and they have spent more than a year selling a message to their supporters and would-be recruits back home.
Khawaja was involved in appeals for donations, video diaries of their lives  and ""through the keyhole"" tours of fighters' quarters.
Shiraz Maher, of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR), at Kings College London, has been tracking foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq.
He says: ""The group that Khawaja was with in Syria was really quite dynamic,"" he says. ""They clearly had people with programming skills - they were able to put together very slick, well produced propaganda videos and posters that appealed to young British Muslims.
""They were able to play on the same cultural anchors and mores that those people recognised and know. They could speak to them as peers.
""Rayat al Tawheed helped a great deal in the early stages of this conflict with portraying the idea of volunteering as a jihadist as quite a glamorous adventurous thing - and a noble thing.""
But Rayat's war was neither noble nor glamorous. Some of its material online showed gruesome scenes of death. One image showed a man's bloodied-hands with the caption ""my first time"".
And another shocking image included Imran Khawaja. In this gruesome picture, the Londoner - masked yet again - is holding a bag that contains a head.
The only thing we know about the victim is that he was supposedly a Syrian army soldier. But we do know that the British security service MI5 was watching - and waiting.
And last June, its opportunity came.
Imran Khawaja decided to come home. It's not clear why because he hasn't told the police.
His cousin Tahir Bhatti, a taxi driver from Watford, agreed to help him return because the family wanted him back safely. Khawaja's own intentions are unclear. He had originally asked his cousin for money for a new gun - something Bhatti did not help him with. And then the fighter began trying to cover his tracks.
As Bhatti, who has admitted assisting an offender, drove to Bulgaria to pick him up, Khawaja faked his own death with an online obituary that said he had died in battle. The announcement asked that Allah grant him the highest position in heaven. He then tried to slip back into Britain unnoticed.
As the pair arrived at Dover, the police were waiting - and they ended up facing prosecution at the Old Bailey.
Cdr Richard Walton, the head of the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism command, says: ""Imran Khawaja is not a vulnerable teenager who has been enticed to travel to Syria.
""This is a man who chosen the path of terrorism, who has chosen to go out to Syria to be trained and engage in a terrorist training camp.
""We don't know why he came back, we don't know what he was planning - but we know he concealed his entry and faked his own death. This is a dangerous man.""
Imran Khawaja was considered so dangerous that while he was on remand, he was held in the special unit for high risk terrorism suspects at London's maximum security Belmarsh prison.
He has admitted four offences:
Tahir Bhatti has pleaded guilty to assisting an offender.
Khawaja had originally faced an additional charge of soliciting to murder. That allegation, the most serious to be made yet against a Syrian fighter, will lie on file.",no

The two parties had teamed up to help inflict defeats on the government concerning the rights of EU citizens and parliamentary approval for a Brexit deal.
But that co-operation went out the window when MPs rejected those amendments - with Lib Dems determined to insist on them and Labour prepared to defer to the Commons.
A Labour source in the Lords told the BBC it was ""fairly obvious grandstanding"" by the Lib Dems, and geared towards content for their campaign leaflets.
""It's pretty unforgiveable to build up false hope with people genuinely worried about their future in Britain, when you already know that MPs were ready to dig in behind the government,"" the source said.

Baroness Ludford seemed sanguine about their chances of coming together again, saying: ""The Liberal Democrats will continue to work with peers from across the House to fight for the issues we agree on.""

""Derek's doing everything he can, extracting every ounce out of the club,"" Thompson told BBC Scotland.
""I thought last summer, could they achieve more than they had done, was it maybe the right time for Derek to go, what else could he do with this Aberdeen team?
""He's come up trumps again. If anything, they've been better than they were last season. With Rangers in the league, with a stronger Hearts team, they've still been the second-top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that.

""Even if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose.""
The Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.
They may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.
""Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side,"" Thompson added. ""Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.
""The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done.""
Meanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha.
The Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select.

""For me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team,"" Thompson said. ""It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side.
""I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling.
""Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.
""If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.""
Thompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.
The 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.
""It's far too early to be making judgements,"" Thompson asserted. ""None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.
""One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.
""Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well. It won't happen this season, but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn't getting results next season, it won't be long before he receives criticism.""",no

He told the BBC's Richard Hamilton about his experiences in the civil war, which ended in 2002, and his Ebola work:
I had a normal family life before the war started in 1991.
But at 15 I was kidnapped by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and taken to the jungle where I was trained on how to use a gun and initiated into the group.
I thought it was the end of my life. It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.
They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.
The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.
Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.
It seems like a nightmare now.
I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.
If they said: ""We don't have food"", we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.
Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.
I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.
Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.
I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.
Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.
He encouraged me saying: ""You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.""
At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.
Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.
He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.
When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.
We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.
Through this so many lives were saved.
There were three key activities.
We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.
We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.
Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.
Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.
People were frightened.
Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.
It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.
One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.
There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.
When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.
We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.
Now I see my life as a changed person.
I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.
We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.
If we invest in them then we are building the future.

The OU's Prof John Domingue told the BBC: ""This has been developed as a tool for tutors to help students.
""We are planning to use this data for students studying in 2015-16.""
The programme, called OU Analyse, was developed at the university during the 2013-14 academic year.
It uses a variety of data sets held by the OU and assesses the likelihood of a student submitting their next assignment by using information gathered from four different algorithms.
The more algorithms that indicate the student will not send in their work - the higher the chance of that happening.
Prof Domingue added: ""We take advantage of the fact that modules are presented many times. One can use the experience of previous students to benefit future students. An interesting fact is that the data of the interactions before the course actually starts, like reading the material available and engaging with forums, is extremely valuable.
""Currently it is deployed on 13 modules, mostly level one modules in order to try to provide timely indicators that students may be struggling.
""The model is tailored to each of the modules and by using this and identifying students, more tailored support may be provided.""
The OU has taken steps to ensure that students' privacy is not compromised by the scheme - putting in place an ethics policy, agreed in consultation with a student committee, to protect their data.
Ruth Tudor, president of the Open University's Students' Association, thinks the scheme is a positive one.
""It's a great idea and a great way of providing targeted support to students who may be struggling and need extra help,"" she told the BBC.
""I would like to think that this would improve the drop-out rate from OU courses. You must remember they take students who have come from no academic background so it is always possible that those people take on more than they think they can manage.
""That's why data analytics will help provide extra support and can help them be successful.""

Scala excused himself from the 2015 elections as he shared nationality with a candidate, Swiss Sepp Blatter.
LFA boss Musa Bility says he will go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport if Scala does not withdraw by Thursday.
The battle to replace long-standing president Blatter takes place in 18 days' time.
""Article 7.4 of the Electoral Regulations is clear that any member of the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee who has a conflict of interest … is thereby barred from sitting as a member of the Committee and must be replaced,"" Bility wrote in a letter to Scala on Monday.
Ahead of elections in May 2015 between Blatter and Prince Ali of Jordan - both Scala and Claudio Sulser, who was also on the Ad-Hoc Electoral Committee, stepped aside for this reason.
""Prior to the final review process, Domenico Scala (as a dual Swiss/Italian national) and Claudio Sulser (as a Swiss national) withdrew from their positions to avoid any appearance of a potential conflict of interest based on nationality,"" Fifa wrote at the time.
However Andreas Bantel, a spokesman for Scala, says ""the fact that a member of the ad-hoc electoral committee has the same nationality as a candidate does not result in a conflict of interest.
""There is no such provision whatsoever in the relevant regulations of Fifa,"" he told BBC Sport.
""For the last election period Mr Scala withdrew because the Swiss candidate was the incumbent President. Scala did so in order to avoid even any appearance of a potential conflicted of interest situation and simply as a precautionary measure on a voluntary base.
""For this election there are five candidates with no incumbent President. Hence, there is no potential conflict of interest at all.""
It remains to be seen whether Bility will go ahead with his threat to take the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
In his letter to Scala, he wants to know why the same process has not been followed ahead of the 26 February election.
""Following an unprecedented period of sustained turmoil and damage for Fifa as an institution, the fairness and integrity of the current electoral process are absolutely vital for Fifa,"" Bility wrote.
""If we do not receive confirmation from the Fifa Ah-Hoc Electoral Committee within three working days of receipt of this latter that you are stepping down … with immediate effect, the Liberian FA reserves its right to challenge that decision by all available routes.""
Bility had hoped to participate in the elections himself before being denied by the Electoral Committee in November after failing an eligibility check.
On Saturday, the Liberian pledged his vote to Prince Ali while urging his fellow Africans to do the same.
Alongside Prince Ali and Infantino, Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Bahrain's Sheikh Salman and South Africa's Tokyo Sexwale are also bidding to replace Blatter as president.

He hinted that other measures aimed at fighting corruption and the black economy might follow.
Urging people to be patient, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said that it would take a few weeks for banks and ATMs to completely replace the old notes, estimated to make up some 85% of the total currency in circulation.
Mr Jaitley said that nearly $30bn in the old notes had so far been deposited in banks across the country.

The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of ""black money"" - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem.

The study, commissioned by education technology charity Tablets for Schools, looked at a representative sample of 671 state and independent schools.
Many pupils reported that they took an internet-connected device to bed to continue social media conversations.
The rapid growth of tablet computers in the classroom was one of the ways in which the study found that young people are immersed in technology at school and home.
Tablets are now being used, at least to some extent, in 68% of primary and 69% of secondary schools, according to the study headed by Barbie Clarke of the Family, Kids and Youth research group.
But researchers found examples of much more intensive use. In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.
The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.
The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.
Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.
But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.
Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.
But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.
And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.
Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.
""The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology,"" she said.
A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.
It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.
The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.
Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet ""addicts"".
About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.
Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.
It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.
Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.
Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.
Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in ""the current century and not the last"".
The benefits are ""difficult to put into league tables"", he says. But they create a ""sense of empowerment"" for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel ""trusted and valued"".
Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.
The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.

Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.

The sound of her friends being butchered in the courtyard outside echoed in her ears.
Cynthia, a 19-year-old student at Garissa's teacher training college on the edge of town, spoke with the studied politeness that I've encountered repeatedly in the past few days in this isolated town, on the hot, dry plains that stretch towards and over the seemingly notional border that separates Kenya from Somalia.
There have been plenty of tears from the survivors of Thursday's killings.
But when confronted by a foreign journalist, each student I met seemed too anxious to reach - more so than in any other similar situation I can remember - for some approximation of composure.
""I'm fine, thanks.""
""Everything is fine now.""
""Thank you for asking.""
I am very wary of reading too much into such things. But I found their politeness increasingly unbearable.
I couldn't shake off the sense that it was somehow linked to the horrors they'd just endured; that it was a lingering echo of the instinctive, terror-driven restraint - a numbed obedience borne out of the purest desperation - that had allowed four gunmen to spend hours sifting, separating, taunting and butchering a huge crowd of young men and women.
These feel like bewildering times for Kenya. Not so much in Garissa. In this poor town on the banks of the slow, brown Tana river, the local ethnic Somali population is used to navigating the complexities of religion and identity.
They are proud Kenyans, but occasionally feel like second-class citizens, suspected by every passing, bribe-hungry policeman of supporting the Islamist militants of al-Shabab across the border.
But elsewhere, Kenya seems preoccupied by other matters; by its own hectic development, its increasingly confident, assertive sense of itself as a modern, industrialised, tolerant nation - albeit one with deep levels of inequality.
Al-Shabab - with its bombs, its medieval values, and blood-curdling threats - feels not just out of place here, but baffling. Something on which to turn one's back.
Perhaps that helps to explain why, despite the 2013 attack at Nairobi's Westgate mall, security in the capital remains noticeably lax.
At Wilson airport this week, a porter helpfully offered to smuggle my bag on to a plane without going through the scanners. When I asked him why, he shrugged and said: ""Oh, I thought you were carrying guns.""
And yet you could argue that Kenya's leaders must have known all this was on the horizon.
For two decades Kenya managed to live alongside one of the world's most anarchic countries. It took in vast numbers of Somali refugees, many of them lived in giant camps near the border, supported by the UN and international NGOs, and helping to stimulate the local economy.
But Somalia's chaos stayed, for the most part, outside of Kenya.
Then, in 2011, the government's patience snapped - partly due to a series of kidnappings along Kenya's tourist-dependent coast.
Troops were sent into Somalia and Kenya's government quickly found itself neck-deep in the murky world of clan politics and patronage, buffer zones, spheres of influence, and the need strike deals with ""friendly"" warlords.
Since then, al-Shabab has lashed out repeatedly at Kenya.
Revenge is part of it. But some would argue that the focus on Kenya is actually a sign of al-Shabab's current weakness, as it loses territory within Somalia to African Union forces and an increasingly confident central government, and seeks to project the illusion of strength elsewhere.
Then there is the fact that al-Shabab is no longer a purely cross-border operation.
It has established deep roots (as President Uhuru Kenyatta acknowledged again on Saturday) within Kenya - roots nourished by the activities of Kenya's heavy-handed security forces and by the growing sense of alienation felt by young men in marginalised communities along the Somali border and the coast.
And then there is Greater Somalia.
It is no secret - indeed it is enshrined in the five-pointed star on the national flag - that Somalis have always cherished the idea of one day uniting all the ethnic Somali regions taken from it at the end of the colonial era - in Ethiopia, Kenya and Djibouti, along with Somaliland - into one Greater Somalia stretching across the Horn of Africa.
Al-Shabab may publicly espouse a global jihadist agenda, but it too is motivated by deeply nationalistic urges.
By attacking non-Muslim students in Garissa, the militants may well have been seeking - in their warped way - to promote the fortunes of Greater Somalia, by sewing divisions between ethnic Somalis and other Kenyans in the area.
Not that there was any hint in Garissa this week, that the militants were succeeding. Quite the opposite.
Yes, it was disappointing to see the way the surviving students were treated by the authorities here - forced to camp out for two days before being bussed out of town.
Surely they deserved better than that. One suspects wealthier students, at a more prestigious college, would have received more prompt support.
But overall such horrific incidents still seem more likely to foster national unity, to bring communities together in shared revulsion, than to divide.",no

Wales hold the record of Championship victories - 26 outright and 12 shared - and a third Grand Slam in nine years would mean they join England on a record 12 Grand Slams.

The ride will raise money to develop young Scottish cycling talent acknowledge the fabulous contribution made to Scottish and British cycling by Millar, who was born in Glasgow in 1958.
His fourth-placed finish in the 1984 Tour de France was a record for a British rider and has since been matched only by Bradley Wiggins in 2009.
For three of the organisers, the sportive is the perfect way to celebrate Millar's achievements. They hope it will safeguard his legacy.
Billy Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene.
Millar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s.
A veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France.
Smith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe.
He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong.
He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut.
""Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s?"" I wondered.
Smith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section.

Lang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: ""In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced.
""Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know.
""So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour.
""He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb.
""The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well.""
Millar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy.
And then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - ""the Caledonian antisyzygy"" on two wheels.
Lang put it thus: ""Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there.""
Bilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: ""Robert was special.
""He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win.
""I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe.
""I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""When he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit.""
The sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event.
The intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects.
""He was one of my idols,"" said Smith. ""He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey.
""I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them.
""And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on.

1.0,1.0,1.0,[],[],15291712,TConvS2S,it has been a momentous year for conservative mps.,"The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history.
Almost all of the pro-European ""big beasts"" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics.
According to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether.
The estimate of more than a hundred outright ""withdrawalists"" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe.
Only ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the ""Better Off Out"" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal.
Today Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water.
That impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity.
One of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now ""mainstream"" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as ""the love that dare not speak its name"".
The other complained of a ""supine approach"" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government.
When the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as ""no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum"".
The Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise.
""The collateral damage from that broken promise"", our un-nameable MP said, ""is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now"".
Could the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg?
There are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too.
Last year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour.
Mr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop ""the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries"".
That theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband.
Maurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies.
He told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause.
All these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again.
And the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe.
Douglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership:
""Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc"", he says, ""we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.""
But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.
Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.
There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.
""So long as Britain is in an economic crisis"", says Tim Montgomerie, ""every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.""

Last month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.
The meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for ""new thinking"" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.
One of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described ""this in-or-out discussion"" as ""a bit crude"", and said she thinks the choice is between ""the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship"".
The wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.
Almost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.
That in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.
Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply ""wave goodbye"" altogether.
And Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.
It is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.
Those MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.

The paper, quoting an account of a meeting of senior regulatory officials on Thursday, said the government had decided to abandon attempts to boost the stock market and instead step up efforts to punish people suspected of ""destabilising the market"".
Chinese authorities tightly control information online and have previously prosecuted internet users for spreading rumours.
The rumours described by the latest statement include reports that a man had jumped to his death in Beijing due to the stock market slump and that as many as 1,300 people were killed in Tianjin blasts, Xinhua said.
The news agency said ""seditious rumours about China's upcoming commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II"" were also among the offences.

It also earned the group an award for Britain's hardest-working band from the Association of Independent Music.
Drummer Dave Harper, who runs the shop, is now looking for a new site. ""We need to be somewhere else,"" he said. ""Not existing is not an option.""
The band opened Pop Recs Ltd to sell their own album in 2013 after realising there were few bricks-and-mortar stores left to sell it.
Housed in the city's former tourist information office, it was originally only meant to be open for a few weeks.
But the band kept it going and their DIY attempts to buck a music industry decline gained support from other independent artists.
It also became a community hub, hosting regular music tuition plus poetry, stitching and toddler groups.
Now, however, they have moved out after Sunderland City Council, which owned the building, sold it for student flats.
Pulled Apart By Horses played the shop's final gig on Saturday.
Harper said he was looking at one possible new premises, and that comments from the shop's regulars had made him realise it was important to reopen.
Things like the poetry group, which has 40 members, and the Saturday morning ""stitch and bitch"", will ""stop happening here"", Harper said.
""That's absolutely terrifying because, if you walk around this city, and if you don't want baked pastry goods or go to a charity shop or cash a cheque or put a bet on, I don't know what people do.

The Sweden striker, who is out of contract after four years at Paris St-Germain, could follow former manager Jose Mourinho to Old Trafford.
Football finance expert Rob Wilson says the 34-year-old would be United's most marketable player since Cristiano Ronaldo, and linking up with the three-time European champions would be a ""match made in heaven"".
Wilson says Ibrahimovic's shirt sales alone would help cover the cost of finishing fifth in the Premier League this season and missing out on the riches of playing in Europe's elite competition, worth up to £50m.
""It would not surprise me if Zlatan sold more shirts than Ronaldo or Lionel Messi,"" Wilson, a lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, told BBC Sport.
""The cost of missing out on the Champions League is £30-50m. Zlatan will help plug that gap significantly with the number of shirts shifted by United.
""It is a match made in heaven. The football club is commercially so aware who will exploit every commercial opportunity.
""To them, they are signing a player who understands commercial endorsements and behaves in a way that allows him to maximise them.
""Put that together and you get the holy grail stakes of shirt sales, and stacks of corporate sponsorship.
""Zlatan is also the sort of player who brings ad hoc ticket buyers to a match, even if it is the Europa League or League Cup.
""It is matching the world's biggest sporting brands with one of the most marketable players, who has cult following, plus it is his career swansong.
""If you marry that with Manchester United, he will probably shift more shirts in the next year than any player in the squad because of the superstar status that he has.""
Wilson claimed that Ibrahimovic could become the face of Manchester United.
""Zlatan has a global profile, and global appeal,"" he said. ""Fans will buy shirts with Ibrahimovic on the back in Africa, South East Asia - markets United had a foothold in but not the leverage.
""Only a few select few players can do that: Gareth Bale, Neymar, Lionel Messi and Ronaldo.""
If they are the off-pitch benefits of signing Ibrahimovic, what else will the enigmatic Swede bring to Old Trafford and the Premier League?
Since making his debut for his hometown club of Malmo in 1999, Ibrahimovic has played for some of Europe's biggest clubs: Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and PSG, commanding transfer fees of more than £120m.
He has scored 392 goals in 677 games and last season was his most prolific, with 50 goals in 51 matches - a record for PSG - while his 38 league goals is also a club record.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Ibrahimovic does not do ordinary goals. He scored four against England in a friendly in 2012, including an amazing overhead kick and then there are the free-kicks, long-range goals, back-heels, flicks and scorpion goals.
Manchester United's FA Cup victory on Saturday was their first trophy since the Premier League title in 2013, when Sir Alex Ferguson retired.
But Ibrahimovic is used to regular success and has won 12 trophies in four seasons at PSG, including the domestic quadruple twice.
While he may not have the same Ballon d'Or collection as Messi or Ronaldo, at least Ibrahimovic can console himself with being - beyond doubt - the best player in Sweden.
The striker has won a record 10 Guldbollen (Golden Ball), the award given to the best male footballer in his home country.
Ibrahimovic is one of the most quotable figures in world football. Here are just a few examples:
Johanna Franden, international football correspondent for Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, has spent four years in Paris reporting on Ibrahimovic.
""He will play up to that image that people had of him,"" Franden told BBC Sport.
""When he says these things there is still a smile behind it, but for the last 15 years he has had so many people telling him how good he is that I think he does believe all of it.""
Ibrahimovic has always enjoyed a spiky relationship with the media and his critics.
In 2015, after the semi-final of the French League Cup, he ordered his team-mates not to talk to journalists. When questioned why, he said: ""Because I am the boss.""
""Only God knows"" was Ibrahimovic's answer when quizzed by a journalist about Sweden's chances against Portugal in the 2014 World Cup play-offs.
""Well, it's a bit hard to ask him"", the reporter said, to which the player replied: ""You're talking to him now.""
On another occasion, he was forced to apologise for describing France in not so endearing terms.
""There will be a clash [with the media],"" said Franden. ""He will not hold back. He is not scared by the media; he will tell the journalists what he thinks.
""You expect if there is any discontent it will leak out.
""He can handle the pressure, but he keeps his private life private, he does not invite the press in and his partner Helena Seger will be in the limelight more than she has been so far.""
Ibrahimovic could soon be linking up with England captain Wayne Rooney.
In a BBC documentary, he said of Rooney: ""I'd prefer to have him in my team than play against him. I've not been lucky enough to play with him but I enjoy seeing him on the pitch. If I cannot play with him, I will watch him.""
But it is fair to say Ibrahimovic has not always enjoyed the best relationship with team-mates and it is safer to stay on his good side.
He once put AC Milan team-mate Gennaro Gattuso in a bin after a training session, in retaliation for being teased by the Italian.
A fight with AC Milan team-mate and 6ft 5in American Oguchi Onyewu ended with a broken rib for Ibrahimovic, he once threatened to break Ajax team-mate Rafael van der Vaart's legs and another time he hit Mido after the Egyptian threw a pair of scissors at him.
Earlier this year, Ibrahimovic told his PSG team-mates at half-time to ""play as I tell you and everything will be fine"".
""It is a good time for him to go to United, as there is not such a clear leader in the squad,"" said Franden.
""If he goes to United it is because Mourinho has told him he will be the number one, the most important voice in the locker room.
""Zlatan wants to be the most important player on the pitch. He is not a leader in the way he talks, but he expects team-mates to listen to him especially when he is not happy. He is also extremely demanding of himself.
""He will be a good example to the young players in how disciplined he is and how hard he works. He is always early for training and one of the last to leave. He eats healthy and does not drink or smoke.""
Former United assistant manager Rene Meulensteen told BBC Radio 5 live: ""In some ways Ibrahimovic is the perfect fit for Manchester United at this moment in time. They have young players in the dressing room and he is a leader, a winner.
""He would bring a lot to the club and really put United back to winning ways""
Ibrahimovic is joining United to link back up with Mourinho, who coached him at Inter Milan for a season from 2008-09.
""From being a cat, I felt like a lion,"" was how Ibrahimovic described the impact of Mourinho in an interview with Radio 5 live.
""He was amazing. He dragged out of me things that no other coach has done before. When I played I felt like a Terminator, I felt so confident under him.""
In his book I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he described Mourinho as a manager he was ""willing to die for"".
""The first time he met my partner Helena, he whispered to her: 'Helena, you have only one mission: feed Zlatan, let him sleep, keep him happy'.""
""Mourinho knows what he is bringing. Zlatan has always wanted to work with him again,"" said Franden.
""He had been very eager and was disappointed Mourinho had not got him in before.
""He said at Inter that Mourinho was the best he had worked with and was disappointed Mourinho has, until now, not picked up the phone to ask him to come. Mourinho has always praised Zlatan.
""When Zlatan left Inter some players said they were two seconds away from getting physical with each other. There was not enough air to breathe but Zlatan is willing to work with him. They are two big egos and they do clash.""
""If Mourinho lights up a room, Guardiola draws the curtains,"" wrote Ibahimovic about former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola, who takes over at Manchester City next season.
He referred to the Spaniard as a ""spineless coward"" in his autobiography, and Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed Ibrahimovic said he ""might punch Pep"" during his time at Barcelona.
Barcelona bought Ibrahimovic for £57m and he scored 21 goals in 51 matches, but he felt he was used incorrectly by Guardiola and once confronted him on the training ground over lack of playing time.
""I said I was being used in the wrong way and that they shouldn't have bought me if they wanted another type of player,"" he wrote about a meeting with Guardiola.
""I told him what a friend had said to me: 'You bought a Ferrari but drive it like a Fiat.'""
Expect fireworks at the Manchester derby next season.
Former team-mate Peter Schmeichel said Ibrahimovic could have the same affect at Old Trafford as Eric Cantona, the iconic French striker.
""United need inspirational players, players that stand alone,"" said the former Denmark keeper.
""We had Cantona in the mid-90s. A lot of what happened in the 1990s would not have happened without him. Now it is time to have someone like that again. Zlatan fits that bill.
""In the last five years Zlatan has only improved his fitness, his abilities and output . His stats are unbelievable. Not just say in the French league, because he does it in Europe and for Sweden. He finds the goals, he finds the tricks, he finds what the crowd needs. I said this before, he was born to play for United.""
Ex-United midfielder Paul Scholes added: ""Zlatan joining United does excite me. I know it might only be one or two years at the most, but he is a fit lad, looks after himself and is a great character, he could pull it off without a shadow of a doubt.""
Brazil left-back Maxwell and Ibrahimovic first met at Ajax in 2001 and have followed each other to Inter Milan, Barcelona and Paris St-Germain. They are close friends.
The pair have won 10 league titles together, so could we see Maxwell join his friend across the English Channel?

US director of national intelligence James Clapper described the leaks as ""extremely damaging"" to national security, but Mr Snowden said he had acted because he found the extent of US surveillance ""horrifying"".
What could the US government see?
According to the documents revealed by Ed Snowden, the US National Security Agency (NSA) has access on a massive scale to individual chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data of individuals.
The US government confirmed it did request millions of phone records from US company Verizon, which included call duration, location and the phone numbers of both parties on individual calls.
How much do the spooks know?
Why every call matters
What can you learn from phone records?
According to the documents, Prism also enabled ""backdoor"" access to the servers of nine major technology companies including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.
These servers would process and store a vast amount of information, including private posts on social media, web chats and internet searches.
All the companies named have denied their involvement, and it is unknown how Prism actually works.
National Security Agency (NSA) Director Keith Alexander said that the eavesdropping operations have helped keep Americans secure - yet cannot provide details. ""If we tell the terrorists every way that we're going to track them, they will get through and Americans will die,"" he said
Some experts question its true powers, with digital forensics professor Peter Sommer telling the BBC the access may be more akin to a ""catflap"" than a ""backdoor"".
""The spooks may be allowed to use these firms' servers but only in respect of a named target,"" he said.
""Or they may get a court order and the firm will provide them with material on a hard-drive or similar.""
What about data-protection laws?
Different countries have different laws regarding data protection, but these tend to aim to regulate what data companies can hold about their customers, what they can do with it and how long they can keep it for - rather than government activity.
Most individual company privacy policies will include a clause suggesting they will share information if legally obliged - and include careful wording about other monitoring.
Facebook's privacy policy, for example, states: "" We use the information [uploaded by users] to prevent potentially illegal activities"".
Are we all being watched?
The ways in which individual governments monitor citizen activity is notoriously secretive in the interests of national security, and officials generally argue that preventing terrorism over-rides protecting privacy.
""You can't have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,"" said US President Barack Obama, defending US surveillance tactics.
Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that phone records were only accessed by the NSA in cases where there was reason to suspect an individual was connected with al-Qaeda or Iran.
Speaking to the BBC UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""law abiding citizens"" in Britain would ""never be aware of all the things... agencies are doing to stop your identity being stolen or to stop a terrorist blowing you up"".
Does it make a difference which country you live in?
User data (such as emails and social media activity) is often not stored in the same country as the users themselves - Facebook for example has a clause in its privacy policy saying that all users must consent to their data being ""transferred to and stored in"" the US.
The US Patriot Act of 2001 gave American authorities new powers over European data stored in this way.
This method of storage is part of cloud computing, in which both storage and processing is carried out away from the individual's own PC.
""Most cloud providers, and certainly the market leaders, fall within the US jurisdiction either because they are US companies or conduct systematic business in the US,"" Axel Arnbak, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam's Institute for Information Law, told CBS News last year after conducting a study into cloud computing, higher education and the act.
""In particular, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments (FISA) Act makes it easy for US authorities to circumvent local government institutions and mandate direct and easy access to cloud data belonging to non-Americans living outside the US, with little or no transparency obligations for such practices - not even the number of actual requests.""
Are other governments involved?
UK Foreign Secretary William Hague has so far refused to confirm or deny whether British government surveillance department GCHQ has had access to Prism.
It is not known whether other governments around the world have been either aware of or involved in the use of Prism, which is reported to have been established in 2007.
In a statement, the EU Justice Commission said it was ""concerned"" about the consequences of Prism for EU citizens and was ""seeking more details"" from the US authorities.
""Where the rights of an EU citizen in a Member State are concerned, it is for a national judge to determine whether data can be lawfully transmitted in accordance with legal requirements (be they national, EU or international),"" said a spokesperson for Justice Commissioner Vivane Reding.
What does this mean for internet use?
William Hague insists that law-abiding citizens have nothing to worry about, and there is no legal way of ""opting out"" of monitoring activity carried out in the name of national or global security.
However privacy concerns about information uploaded to the internet have been around for almost as long as the internet itself, and campaign group Privacy International says the reported existence of Prism confirms its ""worst fears and suspicions"".
""Since many of the world's leading technology companies are based in the US, essentially anyone who participates in our interconnected world and uses popular services like Google or Skype can have their privacy violated through the Prism programme,"" says  Privacy International on its website.
""The US government can have access to much of the world's data, by default, with no recourse.""
Edward Snowden, the source of the leaked documents, said he had acted over concerns about privacy.
""I don't want to live in a society that does these sort of thingsâ€¦ I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded,"" he told the Guardian.",no

Should the 2009 world champion join Williams in 2016, it would bring his career full circle.

He made his F1 debut for Williams in 2000 before moving on to Benetton/Renault, BAR - which became Honda and then Brawn - and finally McLaren in a career in which he has won 15 grands prix.
McLaren have not yet decided who they will pick to drive alongside Fernando Alonso in 2016.
The team have a contractual option to retain Button, which means that the 2009 world champion cannot join another team unless McLaren decide not to keep him - or fail to decide until after whatever date is set in the contract as the team's deadline to do so.
Their other options are their Danish reserve driver Kevin Magnussen, who raced for McLaren alongside Button in 2014, and the Belgian rising star Stoffel Vandoorne, who is leading the GP2 championship. McLaren have contracts with both men.
Williams said they could not comment on driver contracts and Button said he had not yet considered his future.

Bottas, on whom Williams have an option for the next two seasons, said he ""did not know"" whether he would be at Williams next season.
""Nothing is confirmed,"" the Finn said. ""We have to wait and see. As a driver, you want to know as soon as possible but sometimes you have to wait.""
Although Ferrari have pursued various options, sources close to the team say they have decided to put off a decision on Raikkonen's future until later in the summer.
Ferrari president Sergio Marchionne said last month that Raikkonen's ""future is in his own hands"" amid concerns at the team that he is not performing well enough compared to team-mate Sebastian Vettel.
These come on the back of his poor season in 2014 during which he was comprehensively out-performed by former team-mate Alonso.

Raikkonen said: ""I don't know any more than I knew at the start of the year. For me, the whole thing hasn't changed for months. If I knew I would easily say. Unfortunately I don't know.

And Cardinal Keith O'Brien, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, urged Christians to wear a cross to symbolise their beliefs.
It comes amid a growing debate about secularisation in British society.
Meanwhile, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have attended traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor Castle.
During the service at Canterbury Cathedral, Dr Williams said it was the wrong time to ""downgrade the status and professional excellence"" of religious education in schools.
RE is not one of the subjects counting towards the English Baccalaureate, the standard for ranking schools brought in by the coalition government.
The English Baccalaureate ranks secondary schools in England according to the number of pupils who get good GCSEs in English, maths, science, another language and a humanities subject - either geography or history.
Supporters of religious education want to see it included in the humanities category.
By Robert PigottReligious affairs correspondent, BBC News
During his decade as leader of the Church of England, Dr Williams has repeatedly complained that Christianity is being marginalised in British public life.
Today he welcomed what he said was a reduction in active hostility towards religion, but issued a new warning.
It was that ""serious and liberal-minded commentators"" were embracing religion as a socially useful tool - for example for rethinking our ""destructive economic habits"" - but wanted to ""pick out the best bits of religion without all the embarrassing beliefs that go with it"".
The archbishop insisted that it was precisely those awkward beliefs - such as the actual resurrection of Jesus - that mattered in Christianity, and that without them it would cease to make sense.
His fear is that Christianity might survive the active hostility of atheists, only to succumb to a kind of asset stripping which reduced it to a set of well-meaning principles without really saying anything about God.
But the government says it is already a compulsory National Curriculum subject and the English Baccalaureate is to encourage more students to take up geography and history in addition to RE - not instead of it.
In his sermon, Dr Williams said: ""There is plenty to suggest that younger people, while still statistically deeply unlikely to be churchgoers, don't have the hostility to faith that one might expect, but at least share some... sense that there is something here to take seriously - when they have a chance to learn about it.
""It is about the worst possible moment to downgrade the status and professional excellence of religious education in secondary schools.""
Dr Williams said a hostility towards faith and religion in public life may have been tempered by a recent appreciation of the social value of religion.
But he said the ultimate test of Christianity was not whether it was beneficial to the human race, but whether the resurrection of Jesus Christ actually happened.
He said that for Christians a vision of reconciled love between people ""is there only because God raised Jesus"" and that the answer was not in scientific proof, but by the way believers lived with and in their faith.
The latest debate on faith in Britain was ignited after Conservative co-chairwoman Baroness Warsi warned that the nation was under threat from a rising tide of ""militant secularisation"".
The Muslim peer said in February that Europe needed to become ""more confident and more comfortable in its Christianity"".
Research carried out in the same month by a secularist foundation suggested three-quarters of people who describe themselves as Christian in Britain displayed only a low level of belief and practice of the religion.
The Ipsos Mori poll, for the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was rubbished by the Church, with Reverend Giles Fraser, former Canon Chancellor of St Paul's, saying it was not fair to trump people's ""self-identification"" as Christians.
In his Easter Sunday sermon, Cardinal O'Brien told worshippers to ""wear proudly a symbol of the cross of Christ"" each day of their lives.
He also voiced concern at the growing ""marginalisation"" of religion.
Dr Williams also issued a call for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East.
He said: ""A visit to Yad Vashem, the Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem, will convince you why the state of Israel exists and must go on existing.
""A visit to any border checkpoint will convince you that the daily harassment and humiliation of Palestinians of all ages and backgrounds cannot be a justifiable or even sustainable price to pay for security.""
He said: ""We have to prod and nag and encourage the religious leadership in the Holy Land on all sides to speak as if they believed in a God who acts, not only a God who endorses their version of reality.
""We have to pray, to pray for wisdom and strength and endurance for all who are hungry for peace and justice, pray that people will go on looking for a truly shared future.""

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers.
The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International.
All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups.
The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin.
Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.
""I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves,"" he urged readers on Facebook.
Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.
""DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery,"" Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.
To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.
The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.
On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.
But officials deny this. ""We only use data obtained by people we trust and know,"" Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.
On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.
The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the ""genocide"" that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is ""We won't forgive or forget"", and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.
During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: ""Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.""
Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.
Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists ""war criminals"" and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.
They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.
In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.
Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as ""Humpty Dumpty"".
What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.
The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.
In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.
And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.

Leeds Crown Court heard he was more than two times the legal driving limit.
The court was told Green must have consumed the equivalent of 13 pints of beer before going to bed at 02:00 BST.
Harry's mother Pam Whitlam, who worked at the farm's cafe, said her close-knit family had been ""changed forever"".
""It is not OK for anyone, whether on a public road or private land, to be drunk and get behind the wheel of a vehicle,"" she said.
""My hope today, now the court process is complete, is that Harry's life becomes more than one day and as a family we can again remember the good times we shared.""
""We all miss him dearly and it has not got easier with time but harder,"" she added.
""Harry was my youngest son, a much-loved brother, grandson, nephew and cousin.
""The only memories I currently have of Harry are from the day of the accident but his life was so much more.""
Green, who was jailed for 16 months and two weeks, had previously admitted failing to ensure the safety of others.
He was prosecuted under health and safety legislation rather than road traffic law as he was on private land at the time of Harry's death.
During an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), inspectors found he had been walking towards a worker in a closed-off area of the farm when Green backed the tractor into him at about 09:15 on 9 August.

1.0,1.0,1.0,[],[],15291712,TConvS2S,it has been a momentous year for conservative mps.,"The latest intake of Tory MPs is far and away the most Eurosceptic in the Conservative Party's history.
Almost all of the pro-European ""big beasts"" of the Thatcher/Major years - men like Chris Patten and Michael Heseltine - are long gone from front-line politics.
According to Tim Montgomerie, the assiduous student of backbench opinion who writes for the website Conservative Home, a third of those now on the Conservative benches would like to see a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe, and another third would like Britain to come out altogether.
The estimate of more than a hundred outright ""withdrawalists"" - Conservatives who essentially believe in the European policy of the UK Independence Party - suggests many Tory MPs are being coy about what they really believe.
Only ten Conservative MPs have declared their position publicly, by joining the ""Better Off Out"" group, which campaigns openly for withdrawal.
Today Euroscepticism is the iceberg of Tory politics; only the top is visible, but a large and - for the leadership - possibly dangerous mass lies beneath the water.
That impression is reinforced by the fact that two of the MPs I interviewed for BBC Radio 4's Analysis would talk only on condition we concealed their identity.
One of them told me that even though his views are, he believes, now ""mainstream"" in his party, he still sees support for EU withdrawal in Wildean terms as ""the love that dare not speak its name"".
The other complained of a ""supine approach"" to Europe by the Party's leadership since it came into government.
When the Conservatives were in opposition, David Cameron made a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that, should he be elected Prime Minister, he would hold a referendum on any EU Treaty that emerged, as ""no treaty should be ratified without consulting the British people in a referendum"".
The Lisbon treaty was ratified by all EU states before the 2010 general election, but critics maintain that David Cameron reneged on his promise.
""The collateral damage from that broken promise"", our un-nameable MP said, ""is a bit of a black cloud over the government even now"".
Could the government ship be heading towards a collision with the Eurosceptic iceberg?
There are signs of new currents of opinion on Europe swirling through the left of British politics too.
Last year, during the Labour leadership campaign, Ed Balls questioned one of the principles at the heart of the EU and its single market, the free movement of labour.
Mr Balls, now shadow chancellor, said he wanted to stop ""the practice where people can work in our country and send benefits back to their own countries"".
That theme has been picked up by Lord Glasman, the driving force behind the Blue Labour movement - which aims to revitalise the party's traditional grassroots support - and an influential adviser to the Labour leader Ed Miliband.
Maurice Glasman argues against the current EU rules which, he says, encourage people in poorer member states to leave their families to work overseas, arguing the practice can depress workers' incomes in richer economies.
He told Analysis he would be happy to make common cause with Tory Eurosceptics if he concluded it would advance his cause.
All these factors suggest that Europe could soon occupy centre stage in British politics once again.
And the crisis in the eurozone has offered a golden opportunity to those pushing the government to engage in debate about Europe.
Douglas Carswell, Tory backbench MP for Clacton in Essex, and one of the small group of Better Off Out MPs, argues that the eurozone crisis has destroyed the economic case for EU membership:
""Far from joining a prosperous trading bloc"", he says, ""we shackled ourselves to a corpse. We are now actually having to pay to prop up a zombie currency we didn't even join.""
But Mr Carswell appears to be in a minority - not so much in his views, as in his enthusiasm for making Europe a salient issue at this stage of the current parliament.
Tory memories of the bitter divisions of the past over Europe are still raw.
There is also a widespread recognition among Eurosceptic Tories that economic recovery, not Europe, must be the government's priority.
""So long as Britain is in an economic crisis"", says Tim Montgomerie, ""every Conservative MP knows that the focus must be on fixing that, and staying in coalition with the Liberal Democrats as a government of national unity.""

Last month a group of more than a hundred Conservative MPs met in the Thatcher Room of the House of Commons to debate a European strategy.
The meeting's convener, the young MP for Camborne, Redruth and Hayle, and former Cameron aide George Eustice, said the group would be looking for ""new thinking"" on Europe, not campaigning for a referendum on British withdrawal.
One of those who attended the meeting, Clare Perry, a prominent member of the new intake of Tory MPs, described ""this in-or-out discussion"" as ""a bit crude"", and said she thinks the choice is between ""the status quo or a renegotiation of the relationship"".
The wildest card of all is what happens in Europe itself.
Almost everyone now agrees that fundamental reform of the Eurozone is inevitable - whether the Euro survives as a currency or breaks apart.
That in turn is bound to have an impact on Britain's relationship with the Eurozone countries, and may well force changes in the way the wider EU works.
Former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lamont told Analysis that if the Eurozone countries form a tighter fiscal union, Britain might simply ""wave goodbye"" altogether.
And Mark Seddon, a Labour Party activist who runs the People's Pledge campaign for a referendum on EU membership, believes the sort of changes that are likely to come will force the government to put the matter to the public.
It is exhilaratingly uncharted territory, and the choices to be made will probably not become clear until much closer to the next election in 2015.
Those MPs who are so nervous about debating Europe now, may find that by the time they are ready to come out, the terms of the debate have changed beyond all recognition.

This, from a team that has won 182 grands prix, at a win rate of 23.18%, 12 drivers' world championships, and eight constructors' titles. And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.
Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentality
The slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.
Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.
This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.
In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.
They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.
Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.
They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.
But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.
There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.
Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.
In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.
Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.
Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.
But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.
So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.
Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.
So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?
Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.
It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.
This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.
The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.
Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.
They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver ""championships, plural"", as Dennis puts it.
But right now, belief is all they have. And on it rests not only a successful end to the career of one of the sport's greatest ever drivers, but also the reputation of one of its greatest names.

It will be able to issue warning and banning orders against agents acting dishonestly or breaching estate agent laws.
The move follows a decision by the UK government to disband the OFT.
Powys won the competitive bidding process to deliver the service in place of the OFT and will receive Â£170,000 a year to carry out the work.
People complaining about estate agents will still contact their local authority trading standards department, who will prosecute offenders if necessary.
However they will refer cases to Powys if they believe parts of the Estate Agents Act have been breached.
James Munro from Powys council, who will lead the new team, has said he hopes it will show Powys could take on more contracts and outside work in future.

0.4,0.0,1.0,['london'],[],29911712,TConvS2S,a school has been sent back to school after being sent off by students at a school in london.,"Hanson Academy strictly enforced its school uniform policy on Tuesday, with almost 10% of pupils failing to reach the academy's standards.
Angry parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the new measures.
But Hanson Academy claims it ""communicated clearly"" its expectations for this school year.
Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including if they wear hoop earrings, two earrings or more per ear or patterned trousers.
Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors, and there are strict rules about the type of footwear allowed.
Principal Elizabeth Churton told the BBC that a further 63 pupils were sent home on Wednesday.
She said in an earlier statement: ""We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted.
""As forewarned, some students were sent home for this reason.
""They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn.""
The principal said rules were an important part of growing up to get students ready for ""adult life"".
She said: ""This is part and parcel of a much wider push on conduct, on behaviour, on attitudes and respect.
""Uniform and the way in which we wear our clothes is all part and parcel of the way in which we communicate with each other.
""It is all part of the educational experience which you would find in any good to outstanding school.""
Caren Oxlaide's son was one of those sent home for not wearing the regulation black leather shoes.
She said: ""It states black shoes, lace-up, no trainers and flat-soled. That's exactly what his are, pure leather.""
She said buying new shoes was not an easy option.
""I can't really afford them, not on income support. But I've got to somehow do it because my son's education is important.""
Diane Hickey's daughter Cassidy, 13, was sent home on Wednesday because she was wearing black pumps.
""I'm not buying her a new pair of shoes. I'm a single parent. I can't afford a new pair of shoes,"" she said.
Another parent expressed concerns about how they were being informed their children had been sent home.
Fiona Taylor, who has two children aged 13 and 11 at the school, said: ""Parents yesterday didn't receive text messages until after 14:00.
""So all day their children have been sent away and these parents who were out at work did not get informed until late in the afternoon.""
The school insists it will persist with the policy, but Mrs Churton admitted there had been mixed feedback from parents.

""In the second half, we were the better side, but we didn't manage to get the second goal and they ended up equalising,"" said Enrique.
""That said, we deserved to win. It is not the best result for us.""
Barca were poor in the first half but looked set to close the gap on unbeaten Real to three points before Ramos headed home Modric's free-kick.
""It was a very even first half and a second that we were better, we created chances. We continued looking for the second to avoid being levelled, but we were unable to do so,"" added Enrique.
""In my opinion, the performance of the team was higher than that of the rival, but we have to improve, it is clear.
""I say this even when we win, and even when we draw. We can improve in all aspects of the game. We are ambitious.""

0.7,0.5,1.0,"['a year', 'five']",[],38328811,PtGen,it's been a year since the death of a south sudanese man and her five daughters in south sudan.,"United Nations officials rarely use the words ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing,"" but they now say potentially both could envelop the world's youngest country.
Since violence flared in Juba in July and spread to the previously peaceful southern Equatoria states of South Sudan, 340,000 people have fled the violence into neighbouring Uganda.
That is more than any other country this year - the UN says 200,000 people have fled Syria in 2016.
Every day, on average, another 2,500 South Sudanese become refugees, and the stories of what they escaped and what they saw on the way, add to the evidence of killing, rape and the targeting of civilians along ethnic lines.
Nelson Ladu Thomas has twice walked over the small wooden bridge dividing South Sudan and Uganda at an unofficial border crossing known as Busia.
A trickle of a stream divides these two countries and there are small bridges or fallen trees every couple of kilometres.
The first time he crossed was with his immediate family; the second - a day later - was with his brother's wife and her five children who he had gone back to help.
Six-year-old Moriswani was limping up the hill to the Ugandan police post where their possessions were inspected before being allowed on to a reception centre a little further up the road.
I asked him what they had left behind.
""They are killing people, sleeping with wives, stealing. They are not shooting you, they are cutting you with a knife. Even small children can be beaten down,"" Mr Thomas told me.
The children gulped water and sat exhausted in the shade of a harsh sun.
""They don't want us,"" he said, and gave his explanation of why his town of Yei, just 80km (50 miles) from the border, had become a place he had to leave.
""These tribes of Dinka, they don't want Equatorians, they don't want… Nuer. They don't want them.""
Ethnic violence has dominated the crisis in South Sudan.
The civil war began as a dispute between the Dinka President Salva Kiir, and former Vice-President Riek Machar who is Nuer.
Equatorians only started to be targeted in July, when the violence spread to their part of the country after rebel troops fled the capital.
In a long line of people at a nearby refugee reception centre, Otima Amos, 21, explained how he had crossed the border after walking through the bush for many days with 16 other people - most children, and among them two-year-old twins.""We walked up to here - without any other form of transport,"" he said.
""It was very hard because they were killing people. If you were a boy you would be killed, if you were a girl or a woman they would just rape you. If not, you would be killed.""
They were afraid they would be caught as they tried to escape.
Uganda is coping extremely well with the huge influx of refugees.
With the help of aid agencies, within 36 hours each family is allocated a 30m square patch of land and a tarpaulin to set up a shelter and start planting crops.
Faida Sarah arrived in August with her children, but already has okra ready to harvest as well as onions, tomatoes and greens bursting out of the ground.
The reason she left Yei was because one night soldiers came round to her home, demanded car keys from her husband and then hacked him to death just outside the house.
In July Bidi Bidi was a village, but now it is one of the biggest refugee settlements in the world - home to more than a quarter of a million people and covering 250 square kilometres.
But now home to nearly a million refugees, Uganda is beginning to struggle with its generous approach.
""This has been unrelenting since July,"" said Nasir Abel Fernandes, the UNHCR's senior emergency coordinator in northern Uganda.
""The international community has to pay attention, and pressure the South Sudanese leaders to stop this, as it's a massacre of civilians from both sides.""
He says supplying water to the refugees is a problem, as it has to be trucked in.
As many as half the refugees are children, and schools are already running - exams were being marked and a presentation prepared for our visit.
Girls sang and danced in a circle then Patricia Mercy, 16, stepped forward with confidence to deliver her poem.
""War, war, war,"" she began, ""who are you and where do you come from?""
The confidence and resilience of her performance hiding deep trauma.
""You have killed my mother and father, even my brothers and sisters, leaving me to be called an orphan.""
There are so many terrible stories here of what South Sudan is doing to its own people.

1.0,1.0,1.0,[],[],10138849,PtGen,"dr dr [UNK] venter looks set to become a doctor who is a doctor and his wife, in the wake of the vietnam war.","The biologist and entrepreneur turned the effort to map the human genome into a competitive race and, in so doing, was vilified by the scientific community.
Dr Venter has certainly not gained a reputation for modesty about his achievements. ""Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes,"" he was once quoted as saying.
And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.
But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.
After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.
Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.
Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.
As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.
This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.
""Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from,"" he said.
During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.
But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.
Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.
He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.
His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work ""any monkey"" could do.
The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.
And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.
His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.
Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.
Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.
In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.
But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.
The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.
The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.
""I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution,"" he said of the synthetic microbes.
""If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.""",no
0.6,1.0,0.0,[],"[('negotiator', 'urge', 'the government')]",38345826,PtGen,the eu's brexit negotiator has urged the government to sell fish to the european union as a result of brexit negotiations.,"It also warns that Britain may have to allow EU-registered boats to fish in UK waters as part of an overall deal.
Fishing regions around the UK voted heavily in favour of leaving the EU during the referendum campaign.
The Lords review says these communities are at risk of being marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations.
The EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), with its quotas and principle of equal access to commercial fishing grounds for boats from all member states, has often been characterised by the industry as a disaster for Britain.
This dislike helped mobilise many in the industry to campaign for a leave vote in the referendum last June.
Many in the fishing community argue that Brexit now offers the industry the chance to regain control over UK waters and become a leading fish-exporting nation, like Norway.
However, the House of Lords European Union Committee has released a report that looks at the risks and opportunities for the UK industry.
Since UK fishing only produces a half of one percent of GDP and employs just 12,000 fishers, the Lords say that industry might be a low priority for the government but it ""must not be marginalised in the wider Brexit negotiations"".
What complicates the picture is the fact the most commercial fish stocks are in waters that are shared between the UK and other EU coastal states. The vast majority of UK fish are exported, mainly to the EU while a significant proportion of the fish that British consumers eat is imported, often from EU states.
""A successful industry,"" the report says, ""therefore needs continued market access.""
However, that access may come at a price.
""Brexit will involve many trade-offs,"" said Lord Teverson who chairs the Lords EU Energy and Environment sub-committee.
""It may very well be that EU member states demand more access to UK waters than some fishers would want in return for our continued rights to sell fish to the European market with zero tariffs.""
The report also points to the fact that many elements of the CFP should be retained post-Brexit and the UK should ensure that total allowable catches and quotas should continue to be based on scientific advice. The UK will also continue to be under international obligations to co-operate with neighbouring states.
One area of concern, according to the report, may well be that if Britain leaves the EU, the CFP framework which treats the UK as one entity will fall away ""raising the potential of four different fisheries management regimes"" in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, many in the fishing industry still argue that Brexit will bring more opportunities than threats.
Just this week, the EU announced agreement on new quotas under the CFP - many analysts say that it marked an advance for the UK with significant increases in allowable catches for plaice, haddock and prawns.
Responding to the new quotas, representatives from the industry said they believed this augurs well for the future of British fishing outside the EU.
""With Brexit now looming, fishermen can look to the future with real optimism as we are on the cusp of an exciting new era as a coastal state with full control of our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,"" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation said in a statement.
""This will give us the opportunity for fairer shares in catching opportunity and better fit-for-purpose sustainable fisheries management, which will benefit our coastal communities.""
In response to the report, a government spokesperson said: ""As we enter the EU negotiations, the prime minister has been clear we want to ensure British companies have the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the single market.""
""At the same time, leaving the EU is a real opportunity to review fisheries management in order to ensure fair access to quota, sustainable stocks and a healthy marine environment.""

Mr Innes - who said he has struggled to find more work since raising concerns - said the workers now faced cancer fears, and blood tests were ongoing.
He said EnQuest had failed in its duty of care.
The men were working at Thistle, 125 miles (201 km) north east of Shetland, doing shutdown work with pipe equipment.
Mr Innes claimed they were told there was a problem two thirds of the way through the trip.
He claimed a health and safety manager told them a reading had been taken the night before and all the work was stopped.
He said: ""We had all been working on it without the proper PPE (personal protective equipment), because they had assumed it was clear.
""At first we were all in shock.
""We have been exposed to radioactive material for hours at a time.""
